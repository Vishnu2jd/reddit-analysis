Had a sort of confidence that skill will take me to a better place. Worked hard, did everything I was told, did Leetcoding solved around 600 questions, contest rating with 1700+, did web development, MERN, SQL, Java, DevOps. Secured an internship off campus this Feb as an SDE Intern(onsite in BLR stipend of 25K), workplace was super sick numerous meetings, office politics, everyone was trying to save their ass and trying to throw others under the bus. I was one of initial developers , developed applications from scratch(MERN, TS, NEXTJs, Tailwind CSS) moved applications to microservices from monolithic. Asked my company to convert me FTE but they said \u201cwe\u2019re not in a good situation to convert you as a FTE as we\u2019re not doing good business\u201d hence I resigned. Applied to tons of jobs now. Tired of submitting assignments and ghosting. Parents are supportive so not much issue over there had a thought, i might be wrong because I haven\u2019t worked with good organisations but during my job I realised I\u2019m not meant for this. So here\u2019s the final plan I\u2019m going back to my hometown, will start my own business, I\u2019ll look for a remote job or freelanceing to get some funds for my business, I\u2019ve few ideas in my head will work on them. \nI\u2019ll keep this sub updated. \nSorry for any grammatical mistakes and typos. \n\nMerry Christmas Devs!

Indians have to go through scans, even their bags, while there is a different passage for Koreans with zero checking. Felt like a pain when I used to see this. There is a different food court set up, okay with this but seats are arranged separately from where we Indians sit. They see us as if we are minors. Even their car doors are opened by drivers.\n\nAll the key positions are held by Koreans. Even the Department head has no decision-making authorities\n\n**I am well aware of how Indians are treated in South Korea. But In India, how can they treat us like this**\n\n**Edit 0:** I see some comments where ppl telling Indians do the same with other Indians. Grow up, man. Every family has issues but won't ALLOW ANY OUTSIDERS TO INTERFERE OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MY FAMILY\n\n**Edit 1:** Forgot to mention the sir-madam culture there. Not sure who introduced this but we used to call seniors sir and madam\n\n**Edit 2:** Not aware of this but someone said VIP toilets for Koreans. Highly likely to be true as I never saw any Korean in the washroom",

        "Body": "For context, I'm from Europe, and currently working within a multicultural environment, where I have to work with highly skilled individuals, including Indian people. But the fact that they are always online (and actually partaking in meetings) for like 12hrs+ a day, and sometimes going online on weekends makes my head go insane.  \n\n\nFor example, the time difference is +2:30hrs (when here is 10AM, in india is 12:30 PM)  \n\n\nIf I log in at 7AM one day, the indian colleagues are online.  \n\n\nIf I log in at 12PM one day, and log off at 8PM, the indian colleagues are still online, perhaps in a conference.   \n\n\nIf I log in at 8AM on monday, I might see that some indian colleagues were online \"12 hours ago\". Like.. why?  \n\n\nSo what's the catch? Are 12 or even 16 work hours normal in india? Even if you would argue that \"indian market is way more competitive than everywhere else, and people have the culture of pushing working hours to prove themselves\" (Which I'm not sure if it's true or not, I made that up on the spot), that wouldn't really apply in this case because the people I'm talking about are Seniors, Architects and even Managers so its not like someone will steal their job.",

        "Body": "This is not a post to brag. This is just to motivate young graduates or new engineers who feel stuck in WITCH company. \n\nYou might not get salary that you expected from the day you graduate but the experience and learnings you gain will matter. \n\nSo little background, come from lower middle class family, had education loan, didn't know coding till I graduated. \nLuckily somehow cleared one of the WITCH company and joined them. Learnt coding for 3 months in their internship(Asp.net MVC and Python) and after that was put in a project in Angular worked on it for 1 year and then was asked to switch to React + .Net core project(Never say no to change in technology in initial years)\nIn this two years my salary went to 3L to 3.5L. Tried to clear internal exam which would increase salary to 8L multiple times but no luck. Couldn't clear 1st round in first try and couldn't clear interview round in 2nd try. Till here life was not good. \n\nThen I started looking for a switch after giving interviews for 3 months finally got offer from Accenture where the HR who I had final discussion to get 8L CTC sent me an offer letter of 8+2L CTC. The role was in Angular. Started serving notice period didn't look for any other jobs(i know big mistake). \nIn last week of notice period one of my friend referred me to a consultancy company who was looking for immediate joiner react developer. Gave interview and cleared both round and got offer of 13+1L. \n\nSo directly went from. 3.5L to 14L CTC. This was around 2 years ago. \n\nAfter joining the new company worked very hard to improve on React(in WITCH company got the experience but didn't get the technical knowledge required to work in this company). In 6 months earned one spot award and in a year got reputation of React expert(don't know how I got this till date) and got a good hike to 16L CTC. \n\nIn next 6 months clients changed my project 3 times. So started looking out again and got offer and current company decided to retain me at 22L and improved WLB.\n\nAfter a 4 months the project got over and came to bench. At this point I had decided to change the company as current company was getting less and less project and news of layoffs was also around in my company. Although company had decided to let go off people based solely on their performance and I was relatively safe, I was very scared. \n\nAfter 2.5 months on a bench and 10s of round of interviews got offer from a product based startup for 26+2L.\n\nFew learnings - \n1.Never say no to new tech stack in early years bcs you don't know which tech stack would be trending at the time of switch. And if you are a developer have working knowledge to clear interview of atleast 2FE and 2BE stacks.\n\n2.Interviews and real time projects require different kind of knowledge, so try your luck at multiple roles and don't get scared woth JD. \n\n3. Dont reject offer for not getting higher increment, compare it with number of years it would take at your current company. \n\n4. Don't get disheartened with rejection for me 1st switch took 6 months of interviews then took break for 1 month and again started giving interviews then got offer after 2 months. \n\n5.Learn trending technologies to add to your CV. Don't switch main tech stack but learn something like Azure or AWS which will add value. \n\n\nThanks for reading.",

Go this way if and only if you're sure that you'll remain a mediocre till you last in this field.\n\nMy cousin of 10 YoE, joined a product company. They asked details of education right from 10th, their references and Experience letters of all previous employers and reference. He joined and started to work. The pre joining BGV was done before joining. Basic checks of EPFO, experience reference contacts were done. It seems like they'll do an extensive post joining BGV too. Almost all companies does itseems, I'm not sure on this.\n\nThe post joining BGV was done thrice (Three different organisations) for everyone. After 11 months of employment, he has got a mail that all of his BGV checks are done. \n\nAnother guy joined with him at a similar position and pay after few months in his team and was doing good at what was expected out of him. But out of the blue, he was fired for lying on the years of experience he had played in his first organisation. Since both were working in same team, my cousin was surprised on this and asked what had actually happened.\n\nHe had 3 years of gap before joining an actual organisation for work. But he managed to get it as 3 years in the experience letter as a contractor for some (small non-existent namesake) company, so skipped the need to have any PF account for that period. He has somehow escaped in all other organisations BGV, but got caught in this. \n\nHe was blacklisted by the company, and all the 3 BGV organisations. After this happened, he was unemployed for more than 6 months, as he was failing all the pre-joining BGV checks. He then joined and is working now for 3 months in a startup like local company for 5x lesser pay. \n\nSaw one post asking what's wrong in faking experience on this sub and other city sub, hence sharing one of the experiences I've heard. His life is in limbo now, he has two school going children too.\n\nImagine, he is not weak in his skills, and is actually good at what he does, but still his life has now turned upside down. He is planning to go abroad itseems.\n\nNever lie.",

And then he said \"Do you think anyone will pay you this much. The maximum we can give you is 8k per month with 2 years bond and 3 month notice period\" and then he said at the end of 2 years if you performed well you will be earning 20-25k very easily.

I should have asked for more but something is better than nothing.

She schedules the interview, I appear for 2 interviews and clear them.\n\nShe calls me later and tells me I\u2019ve cleared the interview rounds, and she can offer me 7.5 LPA max and she needs my approval to generate offer letter. I was completely baffled by this. I told her this is less than what I get already, she tells me it is what it is. I said no to her. \n\nMinutes later I call her back and ask her to generate offer letter. She asks why? I said I want work life balance and there could be onsite opportunities and I want that. She buys it and generates offer letter after 2 weeks. \n\nWhen I got the mail for offer letter. I rejected it by saying the remuneration is less and wished her luck to find a suitable candidate. I get bombarded by texts from her, mail from her supervisor. I didn\u2019t reply anything.\n\nDo you guys have faced any similar experiences?",

We used to party at our co-founder's place, just sharing this to warn you that even if the environment is very chill, your leaders are very cool then keep in mind that it is just a facade.\n\nNumerous developers have shared this advice, and I'm incredibly grateful I heeded it, even till the last day and never opened my mouth.\n\n",

Whenever there is 15+ years experienced guys doing the interview they make you comfortable and then they move forward. It feels like a discussion rather than a quiz show. The guys who take my interview from US or EU are amazing. They are respectful and you feel like, 'I could work with this guy'.\n\nThe folks, majority of the good orgs I have interviewed, they did the following \n\n1. Showed up on or before time.  \n2. Switched on video.\n3. Prepared themselves to take the interviews.  \n4. Introduced themselves first. \n5. They wanted to have discussion on situational basis. They are ready to accept your POV. \n6. Tech questions were involved but to know do I understand or are bluffing them.\n7. Covered the complete scenarios in 20 mins. \n8. You come out learning something new. \n\nThe bad ones are here \n\n1. Showed up late, no explanation on why they are late : Looking at you EY, TCS and Accenture!\n2. Never switched on video but asked me to be on video. (I do not mind to be the only one on video). \n3. Commented on my dressing ( wearing a polo shirt but was commented, on how I could have been in a Shirt) I am on video, taking call at 9pm on Friday! Looking at you HCL! \n4. Didn't care to introduce themselves . They asked the questions directly. As much as I love the no nonsense approach, a bit of humanity and humility is required  professional standards. \n5. Got too technical on a small code and didn't care to explore the broad knowledge space. ( Could and should have split the interview round into two-three layers) Looking at you EY, LTI! \n6. Doesn't understand the timing concerns. Scheduled for 30 mins, shows up 7 minutes late and drags for 50 mins. ( Hello Tiger analytics!!) \n7. Couldn't communicate in English and supercilious, patronizing!  ( Hello Tiger analytics!!) \n8. The person has never worked on small scale orgs or problems. Treats every org has INR 100 CR + budget for Tech. ( Simple solutions are not worthy. Everything needs to be enterprise scale, even if it is akin killing a mosquito with Brahmos!) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, I do have 10 + years of experience. I take interviews for junior folks. Basic etiquettes should be followed. Every org should have a tool kit on how to take interviews. You need to have correct fit. They guy, who gets hired, would be working with the same folks who take the interview. \n\nThis is a sad system and slowly this is creating dejected folks who are fletch lings. A small amount of kindness helps in making every ones' day.",

The hiring process was pretty easy, first they took online test and then straight to hr round. \nNow the problem was that they did not give any fixed date of joining. First they said it could be till october of that year. Now they started onboarding in november, in which only about 80 people went in.(they started by taking girls first) Now other half students along with me got frustrated as the onboarding was completely random and not based on any merits or anything. Now the company said rest students will be called till mid january of 2024. We got frustraded again as we were not allowed to sit in on other on-campus drives. So we waited till end of january. Now yesterday they said that students are not performing well in the company so rest of us have to go through another technical interview just to go into internship where they pay around 15k. This whole company seems fraud to me. And even after we clear this technical round its not sure when they will onboard us. And after that they will take 4-5 rounds of interview for the fulltime role. Now we 100 studnets are left with little to no options about our placements. So the least I can do is warn you about this company.\n\nOn my personal side, I have wasted about 6-7 months because of this company. I am trying to get back into the game but all my coding skills and dsa knowledge is gone. Entry level internship are quite hard to get in off campus.\nThat's all rant I had for this company.\nThankyou.",

        "Id": "16shx6b",
        "Body": "I come from a tier 1 college, and throughout my four years, I barely focused on my studies but still managed to maintain an 8.1 GPA. I cheated through the OTs and got shortlisted for most companies during campus placements. I was mostly cramming CS concepts before interviews as I didn't have a clue about how everything works. I would search Glassdoor and previously asked coding questions or concepts and learn the solution to those problems.\n\nAfter 3 interviews, I got lucky and was selected for the SWE role. Now, the internship starts in January, and I have no working knowledge of anything \"tech\". I can't confidently say that I know a programming language fully. I have never worked in any other domain (app, web etc.).\n\nNow, the question is: **What topics should I work on before my internship begins so that I don't find myself struggling?** I understand that I will be working on whatever team or project they assign to me, and the purpose of an internship is to learn. I just want to have enough knowledge to be able to comfortably switch from one stack to another. Should I just start DSA from scratch and do leetcode to build logic?\n\nI have no working experience, and I have no idea how the corporate world works. All help is appreciated. Guide me in the right direction.\n\nEDIT 1: I asked my senior who works at the same company (I wasn't completely honest about how I got the job), and he told me that everyone was assigned a different team, so he can't really advise me to work on something particular. He very nonchalantly asked me to just learn version control with git and enjoy my last semester of fun because I wouldn't get time once I started working.\n\nEDIT 2: To the people asking me how I cleared the interviews, you must know how different the situation is for tier 1 students. I see people around me with no tech skills (including me) easily get a 10-15 LPA job just because of the IIT tag and because they maintained a high GPA. Recruiters ignore errors made in the most basic questions if you have a 9+ GPA (a guy couldn't tell the full form of TCP in Cisco interview). The only advise I can give is to have good communication skills (English proficiency).\n\n**FINAL EDIT**: I did not expect the responses to be so wholesome and helpful. I genuinely appreciate each one of you who commented and added value with their experience. A lot of you pointed out that I might have Imposter syndrome which might be true but when you're surrounded by high achieving individuals, questioning your abilities is not surprising (at least that's how I justify this). Although I still feel there's a long way to go in terms of learning.\n\nMany people negated the post because of the tier 1 tag, straight up accusing me of being incompetent and how I don't deserve the job which could definitely be true because I'd be pretty much jobless without my college. But that doesn't nullify the work I had put as a teen. I think I deserved having a little fun after sacrificing 3 years of my teen school life considering I didn't have quota.  \n\nAlas many people thought I was a girl, no I'm not. And the CTC is 20+  which is \"high-paying\" in my opinion. Thanks to each one of you who helped me calm my nerves. ",

        "Body": "Here's my review:\n\n1. Is the content worth it?\n\n* The content is alright, but you can find similar information all over the internet. If you're willing to pay around 10k, you might find structured content elsewhere. There's no need to shell out a large amount like 2.5/3/4/4.5 lakhs just for the content. It's not particularly outstanding, and you also lose access to video recordings after the batch ends.\n\n2. Do mentors really help?\n\n* Mentors are meant to assist, but various factors come into play: a. They themselves work in product-based MNCs or startups, leaving them with limited time. b. They have numerous students to handle, and this can change over time. I didn't receive much help in this regard.\n\n3. Classes schedule:\n\n* The initial 2-3 months are satisfactory, but afterward, issues arise such as frequent class cancellations, rescheduling, and teachers taking leaves. I even noticed once that they canceled our class to conduct a free masterclass to attract more students, without considering the needs of the current batch.\n\n4. Placements:\n\n* This is the most crucial aspect. If you have experience, landing a job is relatively easy, with or without Scaler's assistance. However, if you're a fresher, you should try finding opportunities on your own, as they won't bring companies to you.\n\n5. Management:\n\n* The management is the worst. They don't respond promptly.\n\n**Important**: When I posted a small review on LinkedIn, I received threats from individuals associated with the company. These individuals were already in the WhatsApp group they created. What's even more alarming is that one of the co-founders was present during these threats.\n\nDue to all these reasons, I strongly discourage students from joining this company. We join to learn, not to face threats. Furthermore, paying a substantial amount is not a wise decision. Rest its upto you!",

There were several ways he used to threaten and harass me. Thinking he was a new manager/inexperienced, I put up with it for months on end. But after one rather egregious meeting, I finally raised my concerns with HR (who later claimed that some manager \"coaching\" was given).\n\nHowever, since that discussion with HR, the harassment not only continued, but I was also regularly written up for \"poor performance\" by the manager (with the support of the skip level manager) and within a few months, they decided to put me in a PIP (with ERC/HR involvement and support). I chose not to serve any PIP, and I resigned as soon as I got to know of their decision (as I felt it was clearly a case of retaliation).\n\nI might also add that I was in normal health prior to joining Adobe but after suffering for many months in this atmosphere, I developed health conditions like high Blood Pressure and a heart condition (which most likely developed due to constantly high BP).\n\nI got another job and fast forward 2 years later, I was peacefully working in another company. My health was also holding up reasonably well. Suddenly, I get a purported legal notice on my email (let us say on date XYZ) from some \"lawyer\" who claimed to send this on behalf of this manager and Adobe Systems, falsely accusing me of making some threatening calls/sending threatening emails etc. In this purported \"legal notice\", I was severely threatened with civil damages/criminal legal action if I did not sent an acknowledgment email within 23 hours saying that such actions will not be repeated. I immediately responded saying that I had NOT done anything of this sort, and I have strong concerns against such false accusations.\n\nTwo weeks later, I get another email from this \"lawyer\" accusing me of more such acts and then saying that \"As you have shown no intent of backing down from the delinquent conduct\", hence, a case has been filed against me. Immediately I got in touch with an excellent lawyer in my town, and we sent them a reply to both the ex-manager and to Adobe Systems warning them of legal action in case of any malicious/false legal case. I then came to know that a malicious/false legal case was filed against me by this manager and his manager (basically, my previous manager and my previous skip manager). Though it took me over a year, I fought the case and defeated both of them (with the help of my excellent lawyer).\n\nNow, the main thing is that this malicious/false legal case was actually filed a few hours BEFORE this purported legal notice on date XYZ was sent to me (and not 2 weeks after this purported notice as per their lawyer's email).\n\nTheir modus operandi was as follows. Firstly, they filed a malicious/false case that had no evidence whatsoever. Then, with the awareness that I will almost certainly have no knowledge that a case has just been filed, a purported legal notice was sent to fool me, and threaten/blackmail me (into making a false admission), which could then be further used as \"evidence\" in the case. This attempt to falsely frame me and destroy my life completely failed.\n\nI might also add that they tried other dirty things like intimidating/threatening my lawyer.\n\nI am appalled by the unethical, cruel, cunning and malicious conduct of these so-called \"leaders\" of this company. I am contemplating further legal action against these individuals.\n\nHave others also suffered during their stints in this company? If yes, please feel free to connect.\n\nP.S. I will give some specific information so that others don't get trapped.\n\nThe division is Document Cloud. Both are in product management. Both had been based out of Noida for many years. One of them is a VP and the other is a Senior Director.",

        "Body": "So, it's a startup. I'll just name it Frugal Innovations pvt ltd, it's a startup with no active products in market. My job role is a bit... Of a lot, we have a concept for a App, but no app. So I was responsible for overseeing the development of the app, making documentation for the development team, understanding business requirements and documenting how to make it functional and work with existing plans for the app, as well as making a proper flow of every functionality within the app (I chose  C4 diagrams and Figma for the Flow visualization).  And this job I took on myself without being told to do so.. because the director, my Boss, is not an IT or Software guy. He doesn't have any clue about how an app is made or how a code is written, or even how to make documentations for development or developers. There is no in house development team, he has hired a company for development.\nI was planning to involved in the development by being at the developer company's location, once the development actually starts.\nWell it was already \"almost done\" according to my boss. But it was beyond done, half the things it should have, didn't have it, and the way it was structured, adding any new things, absolutely would break all the code.\n\nMy story of how I lost my job:\nSo I've been working here for 4 months (almost)\nAnd our office time \"ends\" at 5 pm, I said in quotes because it's not official timing, but it is when we all go home. Today was a meeting that I didn't get to know in advanced the timing being at 5 as well. Last time this happened I ended up reaching home at 11pm. So I immediately told \"can't we possibly shift the meeting time a bit early, since after 6, the public bus frequency changes to 45 mins - 75 mins. Boss said \"okay... But since today was meeting I expected you to stay until 8 pm\", I didn't say anything. Went along with my day. Redefined schemas, application flow etc.. meeting time, I got into meeting room. We discussed a few points. I bringed out a thing that we didn't consider that changes the whole db schema we had in mind. (Which I did discuss with my boss the day prior and mention \"we need to discuss it with others\"). After 20-30 mins, the boss said \"hey you can go\". I was like, alright, cool..\n\nUpon reaching home this is what I get (screenshot). I called him to clarify and was told the same thing. I'm not disappointed or sad. But my last company was also a bad experience, well a worse, because it was a scam company, no offer letters, no experience letter, no salary slip, no extra pay for over time (Infinite Orbit Research & Development)\nAnd now this recent experience.. I'm not even sure why I got this treatment all of a sudden. He's out right denying to meet in person and discuss with me. Very unprofessional. \nI mean I could guess reasons, I am not approving of his every idea. Because he has batshit ideas, which always break whatever I had in my mind of how our product will function (pretty sure this is the reason behind the development up until now).\nAlso I arrive late at times, more so in this month, reasons: I cook my own food, clean house, clothes, not that I expected the boss  to understand.\n\nMy role was \"assistant project coordinator\" so I'm pretty sure I need to have a say in a project lol. But rarely if ever he listens to what anyone who has some experience in the field have to say.\nI guess I'm sort of venting here. He did say he will pay me this month's salary in full, just hoping I don't get any remarks on my experience letter.\nWhat breaks me is I was actually invested in this project and wanted it out in real world and actually function.\n\nI'm pretty sure if he ends up seeing this he will put on hold my salary or my experience letter or write terrible remarks on my termination letter if that's what he choses to do. Anyways, I don't care since life has already made me go through enough hells as it is, what's a more.\n\nConfused what should I do now, anyone refer me somewhere, I can have worked with js, reactjs, nodejs, Java, mongo, SQL.\nCreated documentation for application, created schema designs, Have almost  a year of experience with everything I mentioned above but no proof, I'm able to learn new things very fast though. I do have a certification of developing nodejs application on cloud though.\n\nTLDR: old people who start a startup are shet (no offence for any good old guys startup bald people here in this community though).\nAlso don't work in a company that has a office in a effing shipping comtainer \n\nThanks for reading. And yes.. it's very long. Sorry",

        "Body": "Basically a Rant.\n\n\n\nI want to share my recent experience with developer community in India. \nI have a total of 4 years of experience and I was working with a Gurugram based company as Sr. DevOps Consultant at 11 LPA. After joining the Org I was told that I will be assigned to clients. I was key person in training of 5 devops engineers at the client and also SPOC for multiple project. My performance was so good that I got Star of the Month 7 time in my 16 months tenure at that client. My company which I was working for gets my performance report every week and it was never below 8/10. My org was very happy with my performance at the client. Not just that I was part of training program where I trained 5 students to become a devops engineer, contributed in internal projects, became interviewing panellist and gave more business to the org. \n\nWhen my time came for appraisal, with all the contributions I made I was expecting no less than 30%. However after 7 rounds of negotiation, and 1 month down the gutter they agreed to provide me with 15% appraisal and 25% with 1 year bond. Yet a family member of CTO got 120% hike and he was not even contributing to internal projects or anything apart from the client. \nThis boiled my blood. I decided to switch, I applied to over 200 companies, appeared for interview for over 25 companies, kept track of each application and process of the application over excel sheet. Within 1 month I got a good offer of 18LPA and I resigned From the current company\nDuring my 2 months of notice period I got offers from 4 more companies with offer of 22,28,30 and 33 LPA. \n\nI joined the company with 33LPA offer.\n\nI didn\u2019t leave the company because I was getting paid less, I left the organisation because the company was biased towards the people who they knew and promoted them irrespective of their performance, HRs won\u2019t respond in time if you ask them for something , multiple red flags at management level, HR will try to trap you with words like retention bonus (bond in disguise) and get furious when you call \u201cretention bonus\u201d with its real name, bond. \n\nTo all the developers in India, know when you should leave your company.\n\n\nFor everyone asking how to get into devops or roadmap to learn anything in IT, I followed the roadmap shared on the website \nhttps://roadmap.sh\nThis helped me understand my very step that I need to take towards my goal.\n\n\n\nEdit (07/05/23) : \nMy negotiations strategy was very specific to my case because of my background. However some people asked me for it. \nNow I can\u2019t share mine as it won\u2019t help anyone but there is one that was posted by someone else , I am gonna share that here.

        "Body": "All toxic companies that failed to meet the expectation of their employees/Interns(not in any specific order, just a list) :\n\n1) Coding Ninjas: Locked their employees inside. Didn't allow them to leave. The security was told to lock the glass door and not allow anyone working in the office to leave when the shift was over(2023). \n\n2) HDFC Bank: Top executive at HDFC Bank, Pushpal Roy, is seen screaming and verbally abusing his employees/colleagues in an online meeting in Bengali. HDFC Bank, meanwhile, said that the concerned employee has been suspended and a detailed investigation has been initiated which will be undertaken as per Conduct guidelines of the Bank. (2023) \n\n3) BYJUS: We all know what it's about. Go figure, YouTube is your friend. Heavily toxic work culture\n\n4) Cognizant: If you are a fresher out of college, and placed in Cognizant, then good luck. Chances are, they'll change the terms, don't pay any stipend, and make you suffer. They didn't pay their interns for 6 months (2023) \n\n5) Goldman: horribly long working hours, but depends on the team you are assigned to. Heavy pay disparities. International devs are valued more than Indian ones. \n\n6) Mu Sigma: Notorious for toxic management that overworks their staff. Not unheard of to work 70+ hours a week here. Mu Sigma is so infamous that there are two whole subreddits dedicated to it: /r/MuSigmaStories and /r/MuvsBusigma. To top it off they have the longest bond in the industry and routinely threaten legal action if you try to quit. Salaries are low too.\n\n7) Capgemini: One of the worst of all the WITCH companies especially for entry-level devs. They're the only company I've heard of that sometimes asks for a notarized affidavit promising you won't quit the company for two years! Absolutely ridiculous. Not to mention their piss poor salaries.\n\n8) Compassites Software Solutions, Bangalore: The former CEO/ Founder/ director owed crores to 350+ employees while he lived in a 7cr house quite near office.After a while, he used to ask his driver to get his bag to office and out by evening while he worked from home. Anyone bugging him a lot were called to a Starbucks in a mall opposite his apartment and he'll tell sad stories and give false hope that investment is coming. After 3 years many people quit because they took loans to tide themselves over and recovery agents were after them. A dozen employees are fighting a case for over a crore just among themselves. The founder stepped down and put another CEO and he's started one more company. He was also the 50%  partner in another namesake company in Europe where customers pay for the work done by the Indian company. So he and the guy in Europe take their money out of it. \n\n9) Instahyre: Instahyre CEO, calling out the name of an employee who accepted the offer and then reneged. Someone commented in that post saying, if you renege InstaHyre offer, you need to pay them one month salary(2023). \n\n10)Sprinklr: Pays a lot of money, but makes you work 12-14 hours a day including weekends. The engineering team is run by psychopath CTO and SVPs, and whetever they say is final and everyone just has to keep saying yes to them if they want to survive. Product release happens on saturdays + developers have to do on-call for 1 week every month, where you are expected to be available 24x7. 2 am calls are normal. The product is buggy so there are a ton of issues popping up every now and then.\n\n11) Tech Mahindra: They have poor HR policies and management is inept and apathetic towards employees. They ask everyone to follow process using internal systems, but the internal HR tools are from pre 1990s. Management does not care about projects and employee health but only financial income from project. The company has deep seated issues and will do nothing to enquire individuals\u2019 mental health and guarantee a work life balance. The HR does not even care about responding to queries. The CEO is more worried about people\u2019s attires to the office than he is about resolving deep rooted issues. \n\n12) Digital Aptech: didn't pay an employees tds certificates of previous fin. year.\nBroke their own made, employee agreement and didn't pay them as written on the terms (2023). \n\n13) Reliance: Treat employees as slaves. Seniors shouting in the office and still getting best employee award every year. Also asks to work on the weekends with 300-400rs per day and can\u2019t take leave on the weekend.\n\n14) Goodera/Give/Give Grants Segment: Constant leg pulling of each other, instead of focusing on project completion. The teams constantly find reasons to blame other teams. No coordination whatsoever. \n\n15) Bajaj finance: Toxic work culture\n\n16) SBI:  No proper HR policies, specifically relating to employee transfers. Management has zero respect for employees\u2019 personal lives. Middle aged uncles are being transferred to such far off locations in Himachal and Jammu. Work pressure is through the roof. Unethical work practices are being encouraged blatantly. There are cases when customers were forced to take life insurance policy (usually above 50k per year) if they wish to take car or housing loans(retail customers). At one of the meetings at RBO(regional office) they used to refer customers as BAKRA(goat). \n\n17) TCS: A Manager in the Kolkata location who used to abuse his subordinates with expletives like \"suorer baccha\"( son of a pig, literally). HR knew it, nothing happened. That manager still continues. The company survives( and often thrives) due to the dedication of a few loyal employees, who work tirelessly day in and day out and compensating for most of the useless folks. Add to that severe pay disparity. Laterals joined the company with a double salary in the last 2 years, compared to the home grown players with similar experience and skill set.\n Managers(specially mid level ones) are good for nothing, can only read spreadsheets and set up meetings. Yet they are excellent at exploiting their subordinates. How much of a raise so called \"A\" banders got this year, it's a mere 6%. The last two years it was even worse.\n\n18) Axis Bank: After new CEO\u2019s takeover he brought in people from HDFC Life and HDFC Bank and strategically placing them as senior level executives. These Senior level executive brought in the cultural filth with them which was quite prevalent at their previous workplace, nepotism and inebriated egotistical display of power is rampant. They drove out the bankers which actually made what the bank is today, people who used to roll their sleeves and get the job done with their team. Now it mostly feels and looks like a project management company with multiple catchy projects going on with no concrete end results to it. Strategies are talked about in PPTs rather than on ground and the entire thinking is being outsourced to the mid and lower management level employees with executives just do a lip service. Ask these mofos about some topic related to banking, they will skid over it with their global gyaan.\n\n19) Deloitte: Absurd on different level. First of first aboslutely ridiculous pay for both btech and BCA student. Worst thing they hire you, irrespective of your interest they place you in domain they like. ( Some who were great at coding went in testing and other domains, some who really hated coding and applied for other Domains were given technical roles.) Worst work timings, sometimes 9 to 3 am. They just take away your Saturdays by saying \"project demands\" that you can't even charge. Almost every Deloitte employee works till 9 to 10pm. They just capitalise on their Big4 badge. They literally charge 28lakhs to client for which they pay us 3 lakhs. Indian counterparts are treated like second class workforce. HR system is broken. HRs take 10 days to reply after calling and texting multiple times. They will switch your stream mid career if they need. Toxic team leads will put status call at morning so that you start very early and then you'll have client of onshore team calls at night. All over Deloitte good for uppers levels but not for a fresher.\n\n\n20) Upstox: Terrible work environment. They'll drain you completely. 17-18 hours work day is considered extremely normal. Working all weekends is pretty common.  Management comes up with a new requirement driven by Marketing every day and wants it to be done by EOD. If you raise some reasonable concerns about how this change could break things in other places, management thinks you are just making up some excuse because you do not want to work\n\n21) Kellton: Company isn't getting enough projects, so they're cutting costs by firing employees right left. Bond of 1L was taken from all freshers, which isn't being returned in 90% of cases upon termination. Freshers are being hired so the company can get the work done in less capital. Experienced people are fired without proper reason, in unethical ways.\nMods please approve, and pin if possible. And friends, please dm/comment such incidents. I'm tired of such posts. I'll add all such companies here. Long bond duration for freshers. Inconsistent freshers training. \n\n22) Virtusa: poor salary for freshers, and bonds to fool them and misuse them to overwork them. More like a Capgemini 2.0\n\nEdit: Since we'll be going dark from the 12th of this month, I'll be hosting an html on my alt github and link it here. Save it/share it as much as possible. We need to make everyone aware of such malpractices.",

        "Id": "14gpws7",
        "Body": "I worked in The US for 3 years as a Data Scientist and worked on many difficult and amazing projects. I learned many technical skills all the way from Frontend, DevOps and Haskell backend (apart from my Data Science role). I came back to India to pursue other entrepreneurial ventures in tech. Built lots of cool stuff but could not get traction. But that's fine.\n\nNow that I am looking for jobs in India (I just applied without thinking much since I was quite confident with my skills), I find the technical interview landscape here very challenging and difficult. And quite frankly unnecessary and irrelevant to the position. I applied for Full-stack/Python and ML positions. They generally ask DSA questions, which I have never practiced (because I didn't have to before). In US, tech interviews are mostly situational based which I was easily able to answer. But here it feels like my talent and skills are going unrecognized because I am not able to get through the first filter.\n\nSome of these DSA questions are quite easy but since I don't remember certain commands, I just get stuck. Like for example, I didn't know if it was \\`defaultdict\\` or \\`Defaultdict\\` or \\`defaultDict\\`. Just silly things that are easy to figure out by a simple Google search. Which they don't allow.\n\nAnd in this one interview, I had a live coding exercise and the funny thing is I could execute the code block ONLY TWICE!! Something so irrelevant and stupid. And the even funnier thing is I wasted those two tries getting indentation whitespace errors in Python because the code editor wasn't configured properly. And that interviewer didn't even know how to say Kubernetes correctly.\n\nJust when I thought it can't get any worse, In the other ML interview, the interviewer asked me to solve problems using numpy and pandas! without looking up hundreds of commands these libraries have! In the other interview, they gave me a whole Jupyter notebook to solve an entire data analysis question using numpy and pandas without any way to look up commands. WTF!? If I have to, I could memorize Python's built-in functions but Numpy and Pandas libraries!?\n\nFrankly, I am very depressed and disappointed and I am thinking to myself why on earth did I move back to this country!? It feels like my talents and skills aren't recognized. At least in the US, I worked with colleagues who went to Ivy leagues, Oxford alum, and Physics, and Math researchers and they valued me but here I am rejected by someone who knows nothing about programming and can't say Kubernetes correctly.",

        "Id": "198z1wx",
        "Body": "I have lived and worked in both the US and in Europe for almost 9 years. In that time, I have met many Indians, whose main motivation to move to the West is to earn money in USD or Euros, and take advantage of the steep USD-to-INR rate, save up as much as they can, and return to India in the future (maybe after working 5-7 years, or when kids are of school-going age). \n\nHowever, I am seeing that this pattern is coming to an end. CoL has risen sharply in the last 3 years. Inflation is out of control. Supporting a household of 2-3 on a single salary is difficult, especially if you are not in tech or if you live in an HCoL area like California, Paris, or Amsterdam. Things that were considered basic necessities, like owning a car, are luxuries for many. \n\nSpending 50 lakh on a Masters degree, only to find that you have just 3 attempts to get an H1B, else you have to save up enough money to recoup costs of Masters, plus all the lost income that you would have had, if you had never left your job in India - all this is not worth it if your prospects in India are decent. Moreover, Masters in Europe is cheaper, but the net salaries are lower as well. Europe is not exactly for those who want to save money and return to India. \n\nI think brain drain from India, at least in tech, is coming to an end. Maybe professions where there is a huge differential in wages (India vs. West), such as mechanical/ civil / chemical engineers, will continue to move out (hard to see a Mech Eng graduate making 20-25 Lpa out of college). But in tech/IT, there are so many opportunities, at a lower cost of living, that people will choose to stay behind. I guess India is the big winner from the West's Cost of Living crisis. ",

As the salaries have improved in India, no one cares about the poor quality of work & projects. Just come in, stall, get the job done somehow and get your salary.\n\nSorry for the harsh words but this is the case with reddit as well, I want to move to US to move away from these issues. But all the reddit posts comparing India & US only talk about social life, salaries, cost-of-living, bla-bla. No one is really concerned with becoming a \"better engineer\", creating awesome stuff. Due to this, the culture in India is such that people who have to genuinely learn suffer, and end up doing most of the work and getting no extra credit.",

I think that that notion is harming people more than helping them.\n\nCollege courses teach you fundamentals of computer science that ultimately make you a good engineer. What they don't do is teach you practical things. So in an ideal world you need to take your courses seriously and continue building skills outside. \n\nLearning web frameworks, grinding leetcode, collecting certifications like you're Thanos collecting infinity stones feels good but doesn't do much to teach you the fundamentals that are essential to be a good engineer.\n\nMy two cents would be to use your college curriculum as an index for things that you need to study and then study them through equivalent college courses that are available freely from university like cmu, harvard, mit, Stanford and such. The quality of teaching is far better than what most Indian colleges teach. \n\nAs a fresher,, start with CS50 which is from Harvard. That course helped me a lot when I started college and right now it has multiple tracks. I'd recommend trying out all the tracks to get a vast breadth of knowledge and then you can dig deeper into what you like.\n\nAnd if you are a professional struggling to grow your CTC then stop running behind the cool latest stack and go back to basics. \n\nI never enjoyed grinding leetcode or cp because it didn't feel productive to me. Yes I struggled during placements because of it. I struggled to write code in the set time limit not with coming up with the solution but all it took was a couple of companies and a week of looking into the tricks people use to write smaller code and I was able to clear the OA. Interviews with good companies was not an issue because interviews are more like conversations where you get to show off your knowledge (remember knowledge comes from studying and not grinding).\n\nMIT OCW has awesome courses that teach you basic and advanced DSA. I highly recommend that and also this website to brush up on your competitive programming  https://algo.is/ \n\nPS. If you disagree then more power to you. I will not be engaging in arguments in comments.\n\nEdit. I didn't expect this to blow up. Something that I feel I should mention is that you should never take any advice on the internet as a Bible (including this one). Everyone has different struggles and different situations. So understand the context and apply what makes sense to you. There isn't one guaranteed path to success. There are many and you have to find yours.",

The questions are not even conceptual but almost like asking me to do their work for them. The calls aren\u2019t even short ones. They end up over 2 hours long because I have to walk them through every aspect of the code 3-4 times to make them understand. Then they make the change while sharing their screen and run the code while expecting me to be there and solve any errors that come up. \n\nI\u2019m all for helping people but I cannot handle doing my work as well as their work. How do I approach this situation? I don\u2019t want to sound rude or unprofessional. This is taking up a huge chunk of my time as I already have a lot of other meetings throughout the day. \n\nThe person X in question has over 25+ YOE in the industry.\n\nEDIT:\nAfter reading through all comments, I want to say that I\u2019ve tried avoiding this person\u2019s calls but they keep calling till I pick up. I\u2019ve mentioned this to my manager in a very professional and subtle way that our work is getting duplicated and we\u2019re wasting a lot of time.

My father wasn't educated too much so he educated me and my brother through his life and \nhe wasn't alive to see this day that's why i was feeling unfortunate and depressed.\n\nSo, if we talk about internship than Just 1.5 month before on 1st February 2024 i join an start up as Frontend developer intern. Even though my role is Frontend developer i am getting some task on backend as well. Frontend is in react.js and backend is in go lang. I am happy for the task and assignment they have given to me. company CEO is one of the best person I have ever meet. As company is European start up and it is in his early age of 17 to 20 people in team around the world's. All of them are working remotely. My first internship stipend is Rs 39xxx around $500. Company can offer the full time role as well base on performance and company's requirements after 6 month it will be decided.l\n\nMany of the experience and new grads are struggling during this recession and I feel my self as fortunate that i have got this at such initial stage of career. I am really happy for that and will be alway fortunate to the god. \n\nOn last note, If you are experienced folk in industry than i will be really happy if you could give me some suggestion or advive than i will be really happy.\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit: \n\nMany people are asking how i got this offer than here is  answer.\n\nI was contributing to open source project's and searching for opportunities and challenges for open sorce contributors similar like GSOC. Than i got to know about Github octenrhsip program. In which github education collaborate with companies with early age start up. Than there was the challenge as part of selection process i completed that task submitted than i was only one who got selected in comapny.",

However, after all the joy, the night made me realize it was time for a change. Around 3:30 am, I sent an email to my manager at Accenture, copying HR, and officially resigned. The toxic work culture in my current project, juggling two projects, unpredictable shift timings, and lack of motivation and guidance from my lead pushed me to make this decision. Considering I didn't receive a raise or bonus this year while my manager drives a Jeep Compass, I felt it was the right move. I don't have any job offers lined up, but prioritizing my mental health feels like the right decision.\n\nEDIT: I can't believe the support and the encouragement I\u2019m getting after reading all of the comments here. At first, I was a little worried and confused, but deep down, I knew I did the right thing. I have always prioritised my mental health, and you guys get it.

The task involved the setup of a global state manager for our ui that would work with minimum coupling and would be as independent as possible. Essentially, UI should interact with it similar to the useState hook in react. \n  \n  \nOne of my buddies worked on a similar thing last year as a hobby project. I shamelessly asked him if I could copy it, he's a chill guy so he didn't mind, I copy-pasta-ed the code into my project, and since the global state module was supposed to be as independent as possible, this meant more new files and less edits on existing code. Long story short, I was done with the entire thing by EOD and now I'm thinking to put my feet up for the rest of the week.

Now the company thinks this should be the norm and he is consider as the best talent while we are considered as underperformers.\n\n\nSo I have been working in a company for little more than a year. Everything is perfect apart from the fact that I have an overworker in my team. \n\n\nHe always does extra. And it's not just about his tasks. He will interfere in others' tasks as well. For example, one time a teammate of mine was working on a task which had a few boring steps. This guy without telling anyone worked on the weekend and created a script to automate some tasks. Next day sends in the group \"hey I have created some scripts over the weekend to help you\". Other time I was working on something where I needed to use a library I was not familiar with, so I was doing some research. This guy just sends in the group an entire document he prepared about which library to use which not to. No body asked him, it was my task which I was already doing. He has created several rules, checklists etc. without asking anyone and keeps suggesting everyone to follow. Not only that, we have a company wide group for bugs which get reported. He just randomly debugs bugs and sends his analysis for bugs which were not even related to his code. Now, the other teams love it as their work decreases.\n\n\nBut for us, he becomes the benchmark and management wants us to be like him. Recently I had my increment and I wasn't satisfied with the increment I got. I raised this issue with the HR. And I was told \"I do bare minimum\" and \"doing just the tasks assigned to me aren't enough for my increment, for that I already have my salary\". They have told me to be like him several times. He has become the \"jewel\" in the team. Now everyone is expected to be like him or else we  are underperformers. We have been told several times that we can't be like him but atleast we should try. Not just by HR, but by manager, seniors etc.\n\n\nAs a person he's great, will help me even if I call him at 11 pm in the night. Has taught me a lot of things. He deserves all the raise and promotions he gets. But I don't think our raises or promotions should be stopped because of him. I don't want to be like him. I don't think anyone should be like him. \n\n\nWhat do I do? I'm really tired of it. I can't even tell him anything because at this point it's too late and everybody expects us to be like him.",

It led me to think about how to address the problem with my existing skills.\n\nI first ran it as a bookmarklet (which was fun to make [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet)) but turned it into an extension soon after knowing a lot of people wanted it.\n\nAd Speedup ([https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ad-speedup-skip-video-ads/pcjlckhhhmlefmobnnoolakplfppdchi?hl=en](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ad-speedup-skip-video-ads/pcjlckhhhmlefmobnnoolakplfppdchi?hl=en)) mutes the ads and auto-plays the ads 16X, so virtually skips all ads without you noticing them - lightning fast. I also added a free way to summarize long YouTube videos right in the sidebar for people who want it, tho I am not a big fan- it can be turned off and comes in handy sometimes.\n\nIdk but am I right in thinking this also means that content creators still get revenue from videos? This is an even better solution than ad blockers if that's the case, what do you think?\n\nHere is the actual extension code I wrote, you can copy it and use it however you please personally.

Reached 19lpa last year - LLD work, architecture design work, more juniors, more mangement and delegation. Finally switched to 25lpa, different org but still a startup couple of months back. Full stack work just joined recently. Unfortunately, saying goodbye to them at an early stage, as I've saved some money to at least pay for half of my tuition fees. \n\nReason why I did this:\n\nGot bored working in India - same culture everywhere (for those who might question how do I know \"everywhere\", I have many friends who work in IT and they share their corpo stories). Craving for new experience. This 25lpa job or better can wait in India but the young age is going away. The time is slipping..

I belong to a middle-class family but my parents have refused to take a student loan because of interest rates and told me that they will be able to manage these 4yrs. I have, however, seen them worry about being able to make payments and deciding whether they'll have to break their FDs and other lifetime savings, or borrowing money from close relatives for a short time.\n\nEver since the start of my BTech degree, (October 22) I have been trying to manage my own expenses by Freelancing. I ended up accumulating a good chunk of money till now as I'm mostly paid in USD.\n\nMy University released the invoices and today I sent my Dad \u20b980k to help him pay my fees. I initially told him that I'll send \u20b91L and a little more, but I only have UPI, so I decided to send money over a period of two days. He's now saying that I should keep the rest of it with myself and use it to buy certification exams (something I told them I'd do soon).\n\nOverall, I'm really happy to have helped my family. It felt like I was finally able to do something useful with my earnings. Affectionate phrases like \"I'm proud of you,\" or \"I love you\" don't really run in my family, but the way my Dad patted my back and smiled felt like one of the best things ever.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the love in the comment section.

I heard some of my colleagues had the same issues and that they were diagnosed with vitamin d deficiency. So I decided to get my blood tested before I see a doctor for diagnosis. \n\nSo this diagnostic centre had some common tests grouped as \u201cpackages\u201d with a  discount. The vitamin D test I wanted was a part of a package with many more tests I had never heard of. It was not very expensive so I decided to go with that. \n\nThe next day when the results arrived I was shocked to see that there were many more things were off. I had abnormally high cholesterol, high LDL levels, low HDL and the SGPT test which indicates liver function was also high. \n\nI decided to see a general physician first, his preliminary diagnosis after a scan was that it could be liver infection or liver fibrosis (scaring of liver tissue). He recommended that I see a gastroenterologist immediately as this could be something serious. \n\nAfter consultation and some tests I found out I had a fatty liver. This could have led to some thing really serious.\n\nI made this post because I felt like I found this out through some pure luck before it got serious. I would have never know about this if I had not gone for the other tests.  I know there are a lot of people here who work stressful jobs and things like this could just slip through the cracks. \n\nJust take some time out get regular checkups and stay healthy.",

Now as recently as February, another handful of people have been laid off (basically forced to resign). All the employees have been given pay cuts and we haven\u2019t received our variable pay or bonuses. \nWalking into the workplace is depressing these days. The friends I made here no longer work here. There were around 30 people in the area where I sit and now I am alone. People just come in, do their tasks and leave. I do not have lunch buddies anymore. Today I found out that another coworker is leaving. He looked so sad and burnt out.

Calling your boss or employee with any other name than what their actual name can cause someone to backfire because they go beyond personal boundaries. Words like \"mate\", \"buddy\", \"friend\" should be used carefully. Because it skews the balance of power. So only use such words if you ar too close to person or completely avoid it. In some cases it can also sound age discrimination (ageism - immature or elderly) or other sound selfish.\n\nIt's always best to address person from their first name with titles if any.\n\nEdit: In India, the freshers usually use too much of sir/mam.

From what we discussed, he was doing good- completing various projects, learning new tech pretty quickly, etc.\nDuring the last 6 months, he asked his manager for feedback in all his 1:1s. His manager was happy with his performance and just mentioned some general comments to keep improving and become more independent.\n\nRecently, he had some performance review where his manager suddenly gave lot of negative feedback. He brought up even minor mistakes (which he did not mention in earlier 1:1s) and said that he will be putting him on a coaching plan.\nThe coaching plan consists of some tight deadlines where he would have to work a lot, which includes designing some complex projects completely from scratch. The feedback process also looked pretty strict.\n\nMy concern is - his manager kept mentioning how this is just way the company works and nothing personal against him. He even appreciated him for delivering a time-critical and complex project (outside of the coaching plan). So, is this really because of his performance? Or is it related to some culture where one of the teammates is considered for performance improvement? Should he consider the possibility of being fired despite his efforts?\n\nPS: Sorry if I missed any details. Appreciate any insights. TIA!",

They think this is more fair than random, and that they just want recommendations and HR will ultimately decide manually.\n\nI am not sure what to do. Should I just resign or is it possible to refuse to work on this?

I quit my DevOps Internship on the first of May even though I had no other offer, because the workplace was toxic. So toxic that it made me write documentation for KT, took the documentation and ghosted me, didn't pay me for April and didn't give me my letter of experience, etc. \n\nAfter months of frustrations and immense stress, I've finally cracked an interview and I'm more or less joining my dream company. The benefits are insane, and in this market (even if the market was ok), i couldn't have asked for more. I'm talking about, WFH, MacBook, unlimited leaves, fun and healthy work environment, everything.\n\nZindagi bhar ka luck iss ek din me use hogaya touchwood. But this isn't to say that it was just luck. I gave their assignment my best. They wanted me to make a kubernetes deployment of wordpress, custom nginx (openresty lua) and MySQL, and then monitor nginx and my cluster using Prometheus and grafana, all using helm charts and K8s. **FOR AN INTERN POSITION.**\n\nI did it. I picked Kubernetes up from scratch and after 3 sleepless days, i finished it. I was the only applicant who was able to give a proper, working assignment.\n\nI cracked the rest of the interviews today, and I'm in my bed crying right now because I can finally be at peace. I can finally relax. I finally have a job, and I'm happy. \n\nThis goes out to anyone and everyone stressing over the market right now. I know it's absolutely terrible out there.

The money wasn't bad too (around 11-12 LPA in hand, got one small hike since joining). \n\nReasons I quit the job -\n1. Hated it, it didn't start that bad but since last 3 months my hate has grown a lot for my job. Always been waiting for Fridays, absolutely no motivation to complete tickets on time. Also was getting very intimidated everytime Manager called for a meeting, my performance had gone really down. \n2. Not getting any time to work my side projects. Ever since I joined this company, I have done zero side projects. I just don't have enough energy to do them after tiring days of work. \n3. I don't think I'm learning a lot in this company. I've been given just same techstack again and again for last 16 months, I've asked for some UI work as well a few times from my manager, CTO but they always called me out on my performance instead. \n4. My long term goal is to be self employed developer, so I want to fail now when I'm young (I'm 22 now, I can't afford to not take any risks now and regret in future)\n\nMy plan of action -\n1. I will make 6-7 side projects I have in mind and deploy them to Google play store in next 2 months (when I'm in notice period)\n2. I will write atleast one technical paper in one of the techstacks I was working in this company which I really liked. \n\nI also believe that completing above 2 tasks will also help in getting another job (If nothing works out) since it'll improve my resume a lot. My long term goal is to make a lot more money than I'm doing currently, not 2X or 3X, but 20X more money and that can only be done if I become really skilled and give myself enough time to try and fail. \n\nSo any feedbacks, do you think this a bad decision? Am I being oversmart? Or I don't know what I'm talking about? Be honest.",

        "Body": "I saw the first computer in 2006. And fell in love. The only problem? Money. Not just me, my entire family couldn't afford it even if they wanted to. There were days I would think what would happen if I got a computer. And daydream about it -- knowing full well I couldn't get it. We were so poor we couldn't afford a below poverty line certificate. \n\nThere were days my dad would earn 10 Rs a day from his shop. And my mom would work as a tutor and tailor (often at the same families) to buy books for me, my sister and sustain the family. \n\nThere was a cyber cafe where they let me use it for 5Rs an hour (typical rate was Rs. 20 an hour) and I'd go there every single sunday for an hour. I'd note down programming concepts and practice the entire week. Wondering what will be the output, only to find out next week that it doesn't work, and I'd make entire programs in months. But I had fun learning. \n\nIn 7th grade, I got a nokia 5233 because I won the scholarship (and selfishly decided to use the money on a phone instead of funding my family, it'd be money for a month's ration). \n\nAnyways, I wrote code in Python via this thing called Python for S60 and once a few weeks, would get an internet recharge to check the documentations, articles and other forums. \n\nFast forward 2012, Govt. Of assam decided they'd give laptops to people getting 60% and above. I got 61% somehow. And got that laptop. And it came with Ubuntu pre-installed and as I didn't know how to install windows so I learnt linux. \n\nI was doing random hussles to get money, i did photo editing, video editing, events, graphic designs, whatever I could do to earn money. And used that to learn coding. \n\nFinished by B.Sc in 2018, (no major, no surprise there) and got into a school. Had a fight because I set difficult questionnaire (which resulted in students not \"improving\" yoy. They did improve, the paper was set way too difficult)\n\n\nI said f*** it, took my money (INR 5500 a month) for 6 months and left for Bangalore amid much opposition from family. To my surprise, I did get a job in a startup in 2019, in the same month I arrived here. I didn't know much about corporate. But still survived and learnt. \n\nFast forward  3 years and 2 companies later. I got a linkedin inmail from an amazon recruiter. I applied. Took all the interviews, cleared and got a job offer on June 2022. \n\nWhat was more surprising is I got placed in a core alexa team. Was scared when the RIFs happened but our team expanded. \n\nI have went till the last round of Microsoft, Google and Amazon. Cleared Amazon and Microsoft did offer a down levelled position. But I took amazon (as I hate Microsoft because of EEE), the question asked in google was difficult, and i didn't have the most optimal solution. \n\n\nNow, for a person like me, who was ridiculed because I'd skip classes and be on computer all day. It was a dream come true. Anyways, living the dream without any degree. Giving mentorship to IIT (and BITS) Graduates is something I still can't stop giggling over. \n\nNot gonna mention my age, name or personal information. Don't want that indian idol fame, I want to be treated like anyone else, if a IIT guy does something better, I don't wanna justify by crying. Posted because I think, another crazy guy(or girl) like me might exist and he might decide to continue the grind and not feel hopeless. \n\nAmazon is definitely not the end. Goal is to build a company through which I can have a voice and impact society at large. Just savin up till that day comes and learning and working aggressively for that. Wish me luck. \n\nAnd please refrain from feeling pity and commenting randomly. It just feels amazing that if you use alexa, you probably invoke my code multiple times a day. And that's amazing to just think about.",

        "Id": "16r0t3e",
        "Body": "Computer science and programming is a massive field. But all I see in this sub are web devs and wannabe web devs. Is it not concerning that 18-year-olds are asking whether they should focus on react or springboot? If your focus is that narrow from the beginning, you will never see the big picture!\n\nSo lets break that! I want to create a thread of all the unconventional programming jobs, the ones not talked about ever in the sub. I want to create a thread where professionals from different fields pitch their interesting careers. There are a vast amount of lucrative careers that no one even hears about! The focus here is to give them a platform, so that others are aware that these fields exist. Lets break the cycle of depressive posts from freshers who have already given up, and give people something to look forward to.\n\nTo hold the discussion, here are some rules:\n\n**Rule 1**: Discuss the **unpopular** jobs! I have nothing against any group of people, but for this thread alone, lets not discuss the jobs people already talk about on a daily basis. Lets ban the following topics- **Front / back-end/ fullstack web development, AI / ML / Data analysis.** You are free to ask questions in the replies, but lets keep the platform mainly focused on the unconventional stuff.\n\n**Rule 2**: **K**eep **I**t **S**imple, **S**tupid. Describe what you do and why it is interesting but keep the discussion simple. A large number of participants in the sub are students, so try to not discuss domain-specific knowledge as much as possible. An 18 year old who sat for JEE and have some vague idea of comp sci should be able to understand it.\n\n**Rule 3: NO CTC, NO LPA.** Enough with the salary slips! In my experience, it does not matter what you do, if you are good enough to be in the top few percentile in the field, money will follow. Since we are discussing careers, salary discussions are unavoidable. So if you want to hint towards your package, you can only use one of the three categories: **POOR, GOOD, EXCELLENT.** Everyone has a different understanding of these terms, and its completely fine! Please refrain from giving ANY exact figures. This is a **career** thread, not a salary thread.\n\n**Rule 4:** Highlight the following: Why is it interesting? What do you do / how does your day look like? Your favorite language / skill / tool / editor etc which is relevant to your job. Remember, a large number of the viewers are students, so try to highlight anything exciting without discussing salaries. The objective is to inform the next generation of engineers of the opportunities they can aim for!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo start off, lets talk about me!\n\nI am an independent security researcher. I basically get paid to hack stuff and then write a report on how i did it, and ways to mitigate it. While I do have degrees, everything related to this was completely self taught from completely free resources. I operate under a pseudonym. No one knows my name, or my face, where I am from, or which tier 1/2/3/4/50 college I am from. I take up contracts when I like, and am aiming for a permanent work-from-home life. The pay is excellent, as long as you are in the top 10%. Otherwise, it isn't worth it.\n\nWhile it sounds nice, there are plenty of challenges. You need excellent coding skills. To break software, you need to understand it better than the developer who wrote it! Other than that, you have to be constantly up to date with every recent hack and attack vector which was made public. Your skills can get outdated very quickly if you arent updated on a monthly basis. However the primary skill you need is the hacking mentality. I never found a book to learn it from. I picked it up by participating in CTF (capture the flag) competitions, and reading numerous security incident reports. The field is competitive and cut-throat. Either you are making bank, or you are looking for other careers.\n\nI use a variety of languages. Python, JS, Rust, Solidity. My favourite tools are fuzzing tools. Fuzzing is basically spraying a piece of code with random inputs until it breaks! It is an incredibly rewarding and exciting field you can look into.\n\nThe most exciting moment in my career was when I saved 500k USD worth of vulnerable funds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your careers? What do you like about it, why is it unconventional, and why is it exciting? Drop a reply!  \n",

        "Body": "I finally got a job which will pay me around 50k. I can't explain how happy I am right now.\n\nFirst, I will tell you about myself. I graduated from [B.Tech](https://B.Tech)(Mechanical) - 2018 from a Lala college never got any placement from college. Took a year for Govt job preparations, I was unlucky I couldn't find a job then I gave interview and got selected in a Mechanical Company in March 2019. The pay was 8k/ month and at the time of joining they said that I could get increment in 6 months on my performance but they lowered my salary after covering me in EPF scheme. Then a year later COVID came and I had to leave that company because of financial reasons and I joined a Mobile Company (Oppo) as production engineer , I was employed there through 3rd party contractor the pay was good around 28k but working hours were between 13-14 hours/day and u don't get any chair to sit because you have to be on your feet on production line. Then after working for 4 months I left and started preparing for Designing (Solid Works) jobs, I joined an institute but I was unlucky I didn't get any job . After 6 months in July 2021 I was in construction company joined as MEP Engineer . The site was far from my home , I had to ride 40 kms from my home for work. The pay was 12.5k/month and I was not liking there because the salary was 4 months late in that company. I worked there for around 4 months and then I quit. I started looking for coding jobs, I mentioned HTML,CSS and JS in my CV and I was getting calls but I was not prepared for interviews and I got rejected in every interview. I joined a coaching center in my hometown, paid 35k for web dev course ( Full Stack Course ) and tragedy happened. My coaching institute owner fled after teaching me for 2 months. I was worried and started looking for jobs in April 2022 and I got a job in company after 10 days of my job hunting. I joined as a web designer around 9.5k/month , I was happy this time because I was getting entry into the IT field and I was afraid too for not succeeding. I worked as a designer but I felt at that time designing is not cup of my tea and there is not a future for designers in terms of growth and money. In my org they had Ubuntu installed for all of their employees. So, I started learning cloud, and after that I told my boss that please give me some work regarding Linux and Automation . He saw my enthusiasm and started giving me some work to automate. After 2 months he put me in a new project for company which was for installing an application on Linux Servers. First, I completed my work using Shell scripting and then they told me to use Ansible. So I completed that work in Ansible too. Meanwhile , it was a year I was with them they also increased my salary to 14.5 k but for the past 4 months I started feeling that I was not learning anything and my work was not approved on time. Also, I was in dire need of money, I started applying for interviews as Linux SysAdmin and I got a call from govt. org for e-office administrator. I went for an interview and got selected , I was asked plethora of questions about Linux from the scientist and  i was said to deploy a Laravel App on one of their VMs.\n\nFinally, I deployed but I was somehow got late because one of their VMs were not working, but completed my work assigned to me. \n\nNext day, I got a call from them that I got selected and I asked about my salary and I was happy for the work hard work that I did for almost a year.\n\nI have joined them as Deployment Lead and working there for almost 20 days.\n\nFinally , I am happy in at this point in my life. I would also like to thank my one of the bosses from my previous company who helped me initially.",

And now the onshore team has raised a level 2 incidence....\n\nI work in am MNC for a Japan client and they are very strict about how and when thing should be done! \n\nWTF am I gonna do now? I am panicking and fucking scared! We have a meeting at 1PM what am I gonna say?\n\nUpdate: No one said anything about the issue in the 1PM meeting, and my manager asked my senior colleague (1yo) to schedule a meeting for 4 pm to discuss what happened. Then I anxiously waited for 4PM, But the meeting got rescheduled for today(23rd jan 1PM). Next day, we had our daily call at 11AM. And the grant issue got highlighted, the onshore team asked what happened? I was about to open my mic and was about to speak when my manager started talking and said that \"We forgot to grant the access to a user group, it was mistake from our side and is rectified now. We will make sure this won't happen again....... \" But he got to listen a lot that how can this happen? It's such a small thing and all.... I was kinda releived that my manager backed me up but was also listening to the bashing my manager was getting from the onshore team, and it scared me kinda that I'm gonna listen about it from him later. Meeting ended, no one said anything about it, it was chill at our workspace, we were working on our next demand. Now comes the time for the meeting with my manager at 1PM and it again got rescheduled for 4 PM, I again waited anxiously, preparing my statement, preparing the doc that many of you suggested. At 4PM, my manager asked the whole team(3+1) to a nearby meeting room. We got up and went there, we sat down. My manager went to the white board and started writing \"What^all went wrong\" then asked us to suggest him that what according to US went wrong? My team started saying things like peer review, no proper documentation maintained, lack of proper communication etc etc. I was total blank, because this was not how I imagined this meeting to go! All of a sudden he asked me \"Rahul(fake name) what do you think? where we went wrong on Friday?\" I was silent for few seconds and then I said \"I didn't checked the grants file well enough and missed a user group\" to which he asked \"Anything else?\" I said \"Nothing else comes to my mind\" to this he asked \"Who gave you this task to do?\" I replied \"Tanya(fake name)(colleague)\" to which he said \"It was also Tanya's task to validate and review my scripts\" to which she agreed that it was a miss on her part. Then we discussed more about it and discussed how we can avoid this in future. It was a good meeting, no bashing to anyone, no one blamed anything to anyone. We just had a discussion. We were laughing and all in the meeting. In the end he said \"Chill, things happen. People before you also have fucked up, more than yours, equal to yours, less than yours. Still everyone is here. One of them is standing right in front of you. chill. Move on and look forward to improving yourself and your work and focus on next demansld\" He also asked for any suggestions we had for him. My perspective for the whole team and my manager changed today.",

And just after saying this she said -  you have one more round which is a cultural round (I mean what the fuck does this round accomplish?). So I said alright and after giving that round, recruiter said that you're on hold for this position. And why cultural round was more irrelevant in this situation was because I had to go and work on the client's company.\n\nAfter 2-3 weeks she again approached for me for a freelancing role, for which we both agreed on 45k per month. She said you'll have more of a discussion round with the head of the department and I had the discussion with the head next day. \n\n2 days later we had a chat on call in which she said that they have hired another candidate which has 9+ years of experience and is willing to work on same rate as mine (bullshit) which I don't buy at all. \n\nI mean if you have an ideal candidate who has cleared all technical rounds previously and is willing to work within your budget, then why are you approaching other persons at the same time?

Basically, he is a LinkedIn influencer in person, who has written a couple of articles on Medium and now thinks he has been hired to single handedly disrupt the entire existing tech stack. And the worst part is he downplays all the other teams' efforts by condescendingly referring to them as \"backward in tech\", before his boss. \n\nThis is causing his boss, who is not very tech literate, to set unreasonable expectations for other teams, including mine. I was not involved in his hiring so I do not know how this even happened. He does not work in my team but is constantly engaging with us on projects. He talks to my team, where some have over 15+ yoe, in an imposing tone, like he owns us to work for him.\n\nHe has done little to no work himself so far; everything is on whiteboards. We've tried everything to guide him while respecting his aspirations but all he says is, \"I'm not able to apply my full skills here, because there is too much tech backwardness\",  which is not true. He is promising all sorts of magic to his boss and pointing him towards other teams to be the ones to actually work on it, as it is \"not his skillset\".\n\nAs the office politics go, his boss is close to the higher-ups so nobody wants to be on his bad side. I once told him not to come to us untill he has something concrete to show (like a PoC) but this guy has gone back to his boss and bitched about how I am not a cooperative team player and how my entire team hates challenges. \n\nHow does one manage such a person?\n\nEDIT: For those saying I and my team are egoistic, forget the part  where I mention that this new guy is from a different team. His deliverables are his own. The problem starts when he tries to convince his boss to offload his work onto my team, when he should have been capable enough to do it himself. That was his friggin' job description. The guy has been hired as an IC but acts managerial with contempt for the entire current enterprise ecosystem only and only because he lacks the skills to learn and adapt.",

Any how while helping them I understood what the term  chat gpt developer means. \n\nchatGpt can't help them because the way they write the prompts is so hilarious like does it not cross their mind that absolutely no future GPT can understand them unless it starts reading their mind and even then it won't. They didn't give the entire context of the code. Just some lines here and their. The old me would have laughed their ass off. However this is now a daily occurrence.\n\nWorst part is absolutely not understanding any part of the code that chatGPT gave.\n\nMeanwhile even if I use GPT I ask questions about intricate concepts or generic  code not copy paste code.  That helps a lot but simply asking it especially GPT-3.5 is funny.\n\nGood Prompting might change the outcome however ain't no way GPT can take over the real devs jobs because you need someone to communicate what they want.\n\n\nEdit I worked all my life in WITCH and seen some amazing developers in other companies however I don't want to generalize WITCH as bad but at lower pay you get those devs only.

        "Body": "As a 26 year old coming from a tier III college who debated the option of going for masters in US for the longest time, started with 4.5lpa, moved to data scientist positions later, made slow and steady progress and now getting an offer from a product company with 37lpa + stocks makes me feel so relieved.\n After 6 weeks of high focused, multiple applications and reaching out to folks on linkedin, giving interviews every other day, I finally got an offer that is a 90% hike on my cctc. \nFor a long time, I felt undervalued and underpaid in my current company. I had lost motivation to work and decided to start applying even though I heard terrible things about the current job market. \nI updated my resume, got it peer reviewed and improvised upon it. Started reaching out to recruiters and hiring managers on linkedin relentlessly. Few would reply, few wouldn\u2019t. It took a huge hit on my self esteem. \nJust when I thought I can\u2019t handle this stress anymore, I got this offer from a product company after 5 rounds of interview. \nIt\u2019s all about being the right place at the right time and being ready always.  \n\nedit: My job timeline started in 2019 when I joined as a Software Engineer at a fintech company for 4.5lpa. I later switched to a data science position for 15lpa. got 10% hike every year to reach current ctc of 18.5lpa. \nIn the company, I worked hard and made the right moves to get projects with good tech stack. So, that helped me build a well rounded profile. \n",

This growth will probably not reflect in IT sector.\n\nManufacturing, infra, etc. has a lot of room to grow in india unlike IT sector. \nIT will grow in the next decade according to me but could slow down ahead.\nReal estate in india will be very valuable in upcoming times if the country grows at this rate.\n\nIndian IT Startups are actually very nice but doesn't provide majority jobs.\n\nGdp per capita will most likely go upto 7-8x the current levels its currently $2250 so lets take it as $20k.(higher side)\n\nQuality of life will definitely improve in india but as we know many basic issues still exist pollution,etc, etc. won't rant about it.\nWe take a lot of time to fix basic problems.\n\nUSA:\nCurrent gdp ~$25-26tn. In 50 years approx double.\n\nMany cutting edge technologies are developed in the US. AI is highly valuable right now whereas in india there are hardly any notable AI startups. The growth in US gdp could be more due to result of this.\n\nInstead of outsourcing alot of companies will rely on AI or shift to nations with cheaper workforces later on.\n\nGdp per capita is $70k right now could 2x in 50 years.\n\nStartup scene will still be better in the US in our lifetime. Tech salaries in US could still be paid highly.\n\nQuality of life is already good in most developed countries like US.\nThey debate on complex issues politically. This probably wont change in india due to mindset.\n\nRupee will keep depreciating until US defaults which wont happen.\nBig changes like banning notes 500,2000 creates investor doubt they would rather invest in a better banking system like US.\n\nInflation was wild in the dollar itself, rupee still depreciated alot printer going brr in india too.\n\nOverall thoughts:\nDeveloped countries will always have better lifestyle and more wages than India.\n\nWe wont be much of a part of the indian growth story unless we make something ourselves.\n\nThe mindset of tech giants in india is total bs.\nThey want 70 hour workweeks. There is barely any groundbreaking research happening.\nSemiconductor design/manufacturing non existent in india, this will bottleneck AI development in the future believe it or not.\n\nMany startups in india are great for improving quality of life like zomato, ola, etc. but technologial improvements which create big impact need to happen.\n\nMy thoughts:\nYes, India will grow but probably not for us (salary wise), u could invest in stock market, real estate and stonk.\n\nWage growth will occur but will never be high enough due to PPP.\nPPP will remain a significant factor.\n\nThis is a broader perspective about looking into opportunities outside india and also making better things in India, if u care about quality of life, growth etc. for our lifetime.\n\nWork culture hmm\nIn India our ceos/politicians want 70 hrs and whatnot.\nIf a ceo/politician said something like that in a developed country he and his company would get trolled non stop (shares would fall) big reaction.\nWork culture will remain better outside india.\n\nI know job market is very tight right now but this further shows that our IT sector gets impacted by US.\n\nJust some thoughts would love to hear what u guys think.",

Or atleast most of us.Or atleast me.\nAndroid developer with ~8 years of experience here.\nI got laid off in July, apparently not because of money crunch, restructuring, I just couldn't work with the guys.\n\nAnyway, getting laid off is never nice, it fucks up a lot of plans where spending is involved\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.\n\nLuckily has savings and just trying to polish my interview skills, which was apparently never good it seems. \n\nDS-ALGO, combined with the fact that android in past few years has changed so much it's hard to keep up and It's getting boring tbh,but this market is something which I am stumbling upon for the first time in my career as a mobile dev.\n\nEven after 5 months of work on DS algo, doing necessary cramming and what not, I have only got interview with one company who basically said no after 5 rounds of interview(I did well here, solved a difficult ds question(so proud)), well shit happens in interview, but he'll there is no where else to go after this interview process.\n\n\nAfter applying to idk how many companies I have only got rejection at resume itself, I had no idea how good resumes looked, so I started fixing that, got reviews, worked on them, paid money from my pocket to get some opinions from \"experts\", and yet, just yesterday got rejection from angelOne.\n\nWell, in the past all the companies I joined, I never truly had a kind of interview where I ever felt that  any out of the way preparation is required, call me lucky or otherwise, idk, back then I was only asked about android and java, a bit kotlin in last company and rxjava,\nBasically the things we work on.\nAll knowledge I had was implementation based, and reading code from other repos on GitHub.\n\nBut, now since I was failing interviews like anything in July(I was getting callbacks then), I decided to take some time off and learn new android tech, ds-algo, non-mobile based system design and core software engineering principles, and currently I feel great about finally overcoming this hurdle.\nBut I ain't getting any interviews, and idk how many days I can keep myself sane doing these things, just to get rejected on the resume, LOL.\n\nI am not scared, though, the situation I am in will scare the living daylights of me from one year ago, I have no clue where this courage is coming from, probably from my savings account, \ud83d\ude02.\n\nBut what's the purpose, of me telling all this.\n\nTo talk about a MISTAKE which I kept doing, a big one, one which led to seriously fall into a dark place even when everything was working in my favour.\n\nIt was \"avoiding failures\", as I have mentioned above, I never had to do a lot of prep for interviews to get job,\nI started off with x, then shifted to get 3x, then 8x then eventually 15x+insane benefits in the last company, \n\nbut I did give a lot of interviews where ds algo and all those things which I hated, were asked, I was just never able to clear them.\n\nIn earlier days of my career I got call from MakeMyTrip, Oyo Intuit, daily hunt etc, but I always failed in the ds algo round, the only reason I never took as failure and worked on them was because I somehow was cracking some startup where I was getting same or more as a package,\n\n all these years what I considered as success was actually me ignoring/avoiding my failures.\n\nSo why was i not able to understand this, and why understanding this is important?\n\nBecause I was hungry for money, it was my only motivation, and then one day, this motivation died and suddenly I had no motivation in work, I felt fatigued doing a small task, this led to me not being able to clearly convey others their mistake, because I was busy blaming only myself, which led me to burnout and the same company where my graph was going in the sky again, crashed in less than 6 months, no matter what I do everyone in my previous company will simply say he wasn't good enough, because I started believing that.\n\nSo even if I am not getting any interviews, even if I flunk a few, I will now take this time, and solve the only problem which I always ignored, not just to clear interviews, I mean after an year, market will get back to normal and I will be all cha-ching again, but to tell myself, just like I used to,\n\n\"There is nothing you can't do\".\n\nFin.\n\nP.S. for a lot of you this may not even be a problem, but to anyone who makes a lot of silly mistakes, this can add perspective.

The stats showed that OP has been regular on competitive coding platforms for ~400 odd days.\n\nI'd mentioned something similar in a comment on that post as well, but in order to send this message to a broader audience a post would be better.\n\n1. Competitive coding is a sport. It is about solving a small problem with a team of 1. In professional life, that is NEVER going to be the case. Please stop mentioning it in your resum\u00e9, keeping it to your LinkedIn is fine. \n\n2. Instead of wasting your entire time on coding platforms, participate in hackathons. They somewhat simulate real life scenarios where you have to solve a problem with your team and then explain your approach to a jury, which includes focussing on designing scalable code, which unfortunately hardly any fresher cares about. \n\n3. Read about best practices of your language, SOLID principles, latest updates in your language - added features (their pros and cons), and so on. Learn about design patterns (atleast the common ones), implement them. I can guarantee the freshers boasting about their leetcode prowess will crumble in writing the most basic of design pattern. \n\n4. Read about abstraction, scalability and code readability. You are going to work in a team, the code you write will be used and updated later. STOP WRITING SPAGHETTI CODE JUST TO PASS ALL TESTCASES. \n\n5. Open the classes of libraries used in your code. If you're a Java dev, i highly recommend reading them. They are written so beautifully with people who are crazy-level experts. Trying to copy how they write code (designing, implementing and commenting) is going to make you a far better developer. Writing such code is an art, not just engineering.\n\n6. Learn to comment your code properly.\n\n7. Learn about testing frameworks and code coverage. \n\nMy background: I'm a 3YOE Java backend dev with good salary, graduated from a Tier-1 college. \n\nThis is what I've learned so far. You're going to work in a team, it's time you learn a few skills that will help you with it. Hope this helps, good luck!\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your comments. This is in no way a shitpost on competitive coding, it is the cornerstone of logic building. But in no way is it everything, there's a lot more to software engineering than leetcode. Do leetcode, just don't let it be everything you do.",

        "Body": "**Almost a year ago** I posted about \"InstaPlus\" extension in this subreddit - [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/14sr9ct/ive_finally_finished_my_extension_for_instagram_i/). It's been a long time since then. I've got regulatory claim from Meta Inc., they tried to take it down several times. But fortunately I make it work. \n\nAfter almost 8 months of developing it i've got a lot of feedback. Some of the users had no idea how to enable the extension, which make me wonder why: *\"I made it as simpe as it could be. Just why it happens\"*. But I was wrong. I guess it's a good thing, admit your faults and help to grow yourself, as a developer and your product aswell. Also I've got some feedback from people with ADHD:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yh39y4fsxinc1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd114b0c14f33861ca50f00b517f08f2d75700d7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ljlmw5kbyinc1.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=43cd9412ec5cbfa19ff9036dfab27dd3d0a1d0ba\n\nAlso a lot from people with depression and other, related problems. **In total over 78 messages.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apviplmnyinc1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=b846ab92580232a9cfa9e70b38ad8f7978795659\n\n**Honestly I wasn't expected that. Like, at all.** \n\nAnd that make me wonder that I would never make it commercial. Just so more people can use it without being afraid that it will not work next time.  \n\nAlso, at first I made it with closed source code. I was afraid that someone else will copy it. But after seeing all of that feedback, I made it open source from 2 reasons:\n\n1. **Proof of safety:** I would rather use something that can be checked personally.\n2. **Continious Maintaining:** Some people could have great ideas that may help it flow, and gain more features.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Version 1.0.0](https://preview.redd.it/gpc3iijt0jnc1.png?width=440&format=png&auto=webp&s=12025d3e0c08d5399e962b1a1548fd9d3caf1b2a)\n\n[It has way more features than back in a days, and better UI\\/UX](https://preview.redd.it/nkry8nrn0jnc1.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=137572aadd0f1b4b353298bed637ae44ede184dd)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Preview from the Chrome Web Store. ](https://preview.redd.it/l6tglnzn8jnc1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=c69cfd0b6cce6057829c18f81cede005641eb685)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **If you're also interested in this mission, here's how you can help:**\n\n1. **Better translation:** If you're native in any language except English and Ukrainian, Click at the \"Contribute\" button. It will navigate you to locale .txt files. Each contributor was added on the contribute page.\n2. **Code contribution:** Any, even tiniest pull request will help. Huge things always start from tiny steps. Also, the more something is popular - the more it feels as trustworthy. So, more people would know that this solution exist.\n3. **Be the tester:** Install it, test on your browser. Something does not work as it should? Create a new issue on Github. Don't have one? Send it as email. Even 4 words email is better than nothing\n\n# FAQ:\n\n*- What functionality it currently has?* \n\n**- Well, a lot. It's got a lot of feature requests, so basically for now it can disable almost every part of Instagram. For example Reels section, Stories, or recomendations only. It also can disable the feed and navigate you straight to DM's. I personally use it and I think its great feature.**\n\n*- Does it collect any data? If so, then what exactly?*\n\n**- It does not send or recieve any personal data. It only uses browser name to configure, for example the \"rate me\" popup. Just so link is related to current browsers. And it will not change in the future.** \n\n*- Whats the point of making it open-source? Someone could stole it code*\n\n**- Yes, thats true. But I believe it will recieve more benefit from it. I think that this type of a tool should be completely open source, so people could trust it and not being afraid.** \n\n*- Does it actually help with Instagram addiction? I doubt that.*\n\n**- I've got a lot of feedback that it works for people. Of course it may not help for someone, but then you can configure it more perscise. For example, set up the grayscale mode. For some people its just shorts that make them \"addicted\". So disable them makes a huge difference in a screen time.**\n\n*- Does it work on mobile?*\n\n**- Currently, only on Firefox for Android. But i'm working on custom client based on React Native, with iOS 17 it may be possible as an alternative for the official app. Of course it will be open source as well.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Links: \n\nGoogle Web Store - [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/igplus-remove-instagram-r/dbbopjndlaginbghfoibbndhlbpdpapd](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/igplus-remove-instagram-r/dbbopjndlaginbghfoibbndhlbpdpapd?hl=en&authuser=1)\n\nMicrosoft Edge Store - [https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/igplus-remove-instagram/gcjgjfjabmgpainpahloaldflhfnppai?hl=en-GB%2F1000](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/igplus-remove-instagram/gcjgjfjabmgpainpahloaldflhfnppai?hl=en-GB%2F1000)\n\nMozilla Firefox Add-ons - [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/igplus-extension/?utm\\_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm\\_medium=referral&utm\\_content=search](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/igplus-extension/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)\n\nGithub - [https://github.com/gerwld/igplus-extension](https://github.com/gerwld/igplus-extension)\n\nTelegram - [https://t.me/p\\_jaworski](https://t.me/p_jaworski)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

There were around 70-90 people there in that congested office . I have talked to few people and realised they came from places which are 150+ kms away just for this interview. Market is actually bad . Then I got selected for first round where they asked basic jaba questions and then after a wait of 2 hours which was lunch break , they called around 15 people for round 2. In round 2 they asked few moderate java and front end questions. After all these interviews which had some hard questions too , they revealed the job details . Apparently they have tie up with 1000 companies to which they will be sending select candidate's resume .if any company likes it ,they inform us and train us for 3 months which is unpaid. After this we get a 4lpa job and I have to pay them 19k for 3 months . So guys keep grinding and invest in your skills , hope this market improves as I just met many people like me who were desparate freshers .\nSorry I was posting all this rant for the first time so I didn't know whether I should name the company or not .. it's bridgelabz solutions ",

I'm currently working on a prod bugs, and it's getting really difficult for me to solve bugs  here day by day cause there's a constant pressure by my manager on me, and there's no proper structure or documentation or any guidance here in this startup. \nSo apparantly today my manager set up a meeting with me and made me walkthrough him throughout the whole code and make me explain whole code line by line but as I'm currently a intern it was very difficult for me to make him understand whole codebase. It made my confidence so down and made me doubt myself. And there's so much work pressure on every employee, and day by day work culture getting toxic. \nSometimes I feel like lost here cause I'm trying so hard here, but still couldn't give the expected results and they also pays only 20k to a Intern, and apparently if I get a full-time here, I would have to sign a bond for almost 2 years here.\nI'm thinking to resign as soon as my internship get over, but I'm kind of worried about the current job market.\nWhat should I do?",

        "Body": "I find myself in a situation where I am doing relatively well for myself but I think I have taken on too much.\n\nRelevant details\n\n- 31 year old male\n- 5-6 YOE. I had a late start in my career, failed college (so called \"Tier 3\" college) , almost dropped out and didnt finish, then eventually took 7 years to complete a 4 year degree. I was lucky and applied myself after that.\n- I am a Data Scientist/Analyst. Sometimes I do data engineering as well\n- I am overemployed. I have 2 jobs. \n- Job 1 is in India. Pays about 22 LPA\n- Job 1 is good. Great manager. I do the work that I am good at and it's easy. I could it half asleep. Just that sometimes the workload can be a lot. As in I need to spend 6-7 hours of focused time to get it done.\n- Job 2 is in for a Startup in the US. Pays about 62 LPA\n- Again the work here is great. It was hard at first because I was trying to figure it out but now I am comfortable with it as well. Workload is again 4-6 hours each day.\n- Apart from this, I am also pursuing a Masters in Science in Analytics/Data Science from a top 25 university in the USA. \n- This is a tough program and it requires me to put like 15-20 hours of study every week. (I do this mostly on weekends and when I have the time between work)\n\n\nAll this means that:\n\n- I hardly have any free time\n- I am constantly tired and playing catch up. Do work on Job 1 and then catch up on Job 2 and then Class. At the end of the day I am so drained. \n- I miss important things like updating my resume and applying to new jobs. I have wanted to create and update my portfolio of projects which I have not been able to do. You might ask why I am doing this since I already have 2 jobs. This is because I consider my India salary as my true salary. I am working as a contractor in the US job so I dont consider that as 'safe'. I know this is flawed thinking with the layoffs and everything and even jobs in India arent safe. But you get what I mean.\n- There are other things that I can do to upskill myself and get immediate results which I am not able to do. (Certifications etc) \n- Unable to workout consistently\n\n- Sometimes I miss other obligations in life. Like spend time with family.\n- Not able to engage in hobbies as much. I love playing games on the playstation and steam deck. I love to read for pleasure.\n- Also unable to do other fun things in life that you do just coz you want to. (Like I want to learn Japanese and Arabic. I want to learn to do art. And play the guitar)\n\n\nAt the same time, I dont want to give up on either of these things. I know that these are good for me in the long run. So I just try to fit these things in my schedule. Push meetings and deadlines. (I have a senior-ish role in both the jobs so I can somewhat push\n\nSo to be honest, I am not sure how to go ahead. It's a lot that I do and it takes a lot out of me. I'm just being patient and telling myself that it will get better and I am sure it will, but I feel like a racehorce that has blinders on. I see nothing but ahead. And I dont see anything else to the sides.\n\nAnd for people that are going to DM me, here are some quick answers to your question\n\nQ: How did I get job 2?\nA: LinkedIn > Apply on Website > Interview > Offer\n\nQ: Do I have any roles/internships for you?\n\nA: I dont. And not if that is your first question. Whenever you reach out to others in the industry, please think about it from their point of view as well. Most of us dont have jobs to give away left and right. Write a template message introducing yourself and share what your skills are. Ask meaningful questions. \n\nQ: How to get roles abroad?\n\nA: A lot of it is luck. But you need to have the skills to grab hold of that luck when it knocks. There is no list of skills that will get you through the door. I know times are hard and it is not easy to hear this. But you just have to keep doing what you can. Learn. Study. Engage fully with what you're doing. Not just from the point of view of the job. And then apply, apply, apply.\n\nQ: What is the Masters program I am enrolled into? What does it take to get into it? \n\nA: It's Georgia Institute Of Technology's MS in Analytics. Fun fact: I got rejected the first time I applied. I didnt have the right YOE and the right experience in general. I did their MicroMasters to show that I have the chops for the program and then applied again. I also needed to write a Statement Of Purpose. And I needed 3 recommendation letters. I got one from my direct reporting manager in Indian Company. One from the CEO of the startup and another from the General Manager of my Indian company.  It's a tough program and it takes a lot to get through it. \n\nQ: What skills do you need?\n\nA: I can only tell you from the point of view of a data analyst and scientist. Python, SQL are your basics. Look up SQL questions on Leetcode, Stratascratch. Look up questions on YouTube. But dont overdo it. Know your fundamentals. And in the interview, be articulate about your process. Apart from these two there are dozens of tools and software. The skill that you need to actually know is to learn new things on the go. Even I am not great at it. I need twice the time to understand something compared to some of my peers. But I am persistant as fuck.",

If not, then they go watch a movie in a theatre or go to a pub.\n\nYou can go out twice a month to somewhere near but long-distance trips or partying all weekend sounds tiring to me. I have been trying to go out every weekend for a couple of months, but I'm doing it just so I have something to say about my weekend when I'm asked, rather than enjoying it.\n\nIn college, the culture of building new things outside regular schoolwork was appreciated but I don't find that here.\n\nI don't want to sound like a boring person to my colleagues (I probably already look like one to them), but that boring stuff (coding) is what I enjoy and feels fulfilling to me.

        "Body": "Hey fellow devs,\n\nI secured a 6-month internship at a reputable company through my college placements. It was an exciting opportunity for me to gain practical experience in the field I'm passionate about. To my surprise, another girl from my class also got selected and joined at the same time.\n\nNow, I don't mean to boast, but when it comes to coding, I'm pretty darn good. I can confidently say that my coding skills were superior to this girl's, who struggled even with the basics of HTML. We would chat occasionally at the office, and being the helpful person that I am, I would even lend her a hand with debugging during our Zoom calls.\n\nAs the internship progressed, I started envisioning a promising future in this company. With just a month remaining before the end of our internships, I approached my manager and inquired about the possibility of full-time conversion.\n\nTo my dismay, he informed me that the company was currently experiencing a hiring freeze due to a layoff season, and similar reasons were given to my fellow intern. We both were kind of disappointed with this, but then we just laughed it off, thinking that life might have better things in store for us.\n\nFast forward to the completion of my internship, I decided to head back to my hometown. Little did I know that a few weeks later, news would reach me that the girl\u2014yes, the same one with subpar coding skills\u2014had received an offer from the company.\n\nNow, I'm left here questioning everything. Is this how pretty privilege works? Did my skills and dedication mean nothing in the face of outward appearance? Where did I go wrong? It's a disheartening realization that in this competitive world, superficial qualities seem to trump competence and hard work.\n\nTL;DR: \nSecured a 6-month internship alongside another girl.\nExcelling in coding while she struggled with basics.\nHoped for full-time conversion, but company claimed a hiring freeze.\nGirl with subpar coding skills received an offer.\nLeft questioning if pretty privilege played a part and what went wrong.",

None of the examples here are concerned about the language Go/Java/GCP etc. But they all want your skills of system design, distributed systems, concurrency, latency optimisation etc. \n\nMy present manager (in a U.S. startup) was an ex Google/FB L/E7. He always hires people who can learn fast and have strong fundamentals. For example people around me got onboarded and started delivering in a new language (Go) and GCP in 15 days. I can vouch that the same happens in faang and big unicorns. Heck I have been many a times told to choose my own tech stack while I was in a faangmula. You need to develop this skill rather than learning every function and method of react/Java/go/azure etc",

        "Body": "**TLDR**: Went from 3 to 30 LPA in this economy & job market in 2 years.  My story and tips for others. NO BS!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Target Audience: Mid/Senior Level Skilled Employees who are fed up from job & want to leave. Or if you want to understand market scenario in general.  \n>  \n>Some of below lines may hurt you. Sorry if it does, but these are facts from my POV.\n\n  \n**WARNING**: Very long post, but something I wrote myself to help my fellow developers progress out there. This took almost 1.5 hours to write.\n\n# About:\n\nI was truly able to **10x my CTC in 2 years**. The trick of-course is switching companies but with a smart mindset. And if I was able to do it, I am damn sure with discipline & consistency, you can too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Before reading more, you might want to read about my 1st switch from last year, where I was able to go from 3.3 LPA to almost 15 LPA. Link is below-  \n>  \n>[https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/s/xg9g2h0B1W](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/s/xg9g2h0B1W)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# My Story after above post:\n\nSo I left my previous company after a year, back in Sep 2023 because of various reasons like politics, toxicity, stagnant growth, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that I took a **break completely** from everything for a month & began my job search from mid of November 2023, after Diwali to get ready for my 2nd switch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# My prep plan-\n\nI started applying **15-20 jobs daily** (some days none, some days a lot). Reformatted my resume points every 15 days to test which ones gave more responses. Add some smart projects, not tic-tac-toes or clones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the first 5-6 interviews I was completely nervous & lacked knowledge. But as I kept on interviewing, I noticed patterns like which topics to focus more on, how to prepare better & how to handle those arrogant lowballing evil HR's.\n\n>*NOTE: I am not against HR in general. I have met many great HR's. But some are truly scum of earth who want to rip off employees.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need be focused, smart & consistent!\n\n# Current job market-\n\nAfter giving a ton of interviews till now, I realised the condition of market, about how it may seem very ugly & bad, but it wasn't really. There is NO shortage of vacancies for skilled people in the right roles. But taking advantage of rumours, how HR's & companies want to lowball them.   \n\n\nYes, its tough. But not impossible. Jobs are there, only competition is high, learn how to be different!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was expecting a good culture with around 20-25 LPA against my current 15 LPA. But most HR simply saying as I don't have any job & because of current job market, 80% hike is impossible. We can do 15-16 LPA max if you join from next day after clearing interviews.\n\nBut instead of giving up to these LALA people, I had my head straight & didn't give up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Prep tips-\n\n1. **Fundamentals -** Make your fundamentals strong, so strong you are able to make anyone silent with your answers. If you are focusing for junior or fresher level roles, target DSA especially. **Don't be just another MERN stack dude who completed a course & now thinking of 1 Cr job.**  \n \nIf you are going for senior level roles like me, medium level DSA + System Design + DBMS is a must at minimum. Problem solving skills are key.  \nAnd when I say DSA, I don't mean watching those bhaiya & didis course & solving & copying leetcode. I want you to truly understand how each DS works internally, their trade-off, when to use them. Like if I am building a social site, how do I use graph & its actual implementation. How can I improve my code performance & how do I make it go from O(n log n) to O(n).  \n\nWhen I say DBMS, I don't mean MongoDB or SQL basics from a 1 hour tutorial. I want you go deep. How do they work, how to improve their response rate. What is sharing, replication. How to implement them. How many indexing are there, knowing when & how to use each. Actually knowing when to use SQL or Mongo or Cassandra, etc.  \n\nWhen I say system design, I dont mean go learn Load Balancer & design URL Shortener. Deep dive, learn things. Watch bytebytego playlist on YT. Understand analytics & include them while designing. Understand scalability.\n\n\n2. **Resume-** You all must have heard of ATS friendly resume. Let me tell you 95% of employees have it, so its NOTHING special & its a basic requirement. What makes your resume truly stand out is what special things you did in previous company. If anyone asks you about a point you wrote, make sure you know it inside out.  \nDon't write \"Improved system performance by 15% using Node.js\".\n\nBRO everyone knows you didn't do shit. Write how exactly you did, what you did. Like \"Improved ta-calculation module performance by 15% by using clustering in Node.js\". And if anyone asks you 100 questions about it, you need to be able to answer all 100. Like why were you using calculation module, why nodejs, why not java. YOU NEED TO KNOW ALL THIS!\n\n\n3. **Courses-** DON'T fall for those bhaiya & didis courses. I haven't bought or needed to pirate any paid course at all. Every bit of information if available for free out there. **You just need to get rid of spoon feeding habbit**, which we Indians usually have.  \n\nGo read those algo books. Go read newsletters, go explore GitHub. Go read blogs! Don't fall for those courses or that twitter BS of posting your weather app & tagging a bhaiya. They just promote it to improve their followers & later promote courses.\n\n\n4. **Patience & Mental Health -** Overall being jobless is very depressive. Each day you might think to just go for even a data entry job paying 5k/month. **BRO YOU ARE WORTH A LOT MORE!** Dont let anyone tell you anything different.   \n\nYou need to take care of your family. Don't give up, when you get overwhelmed from job search, take 2-3 days break. When I left my previous role I already had an idea, might take atleast 6-7 months to find job. Only take the risk if you are ready for this. **Take care of your health!**\n\n\n5. **Negotiable & Mindset -** Learn slowly how to handle these HR's & companies. Nobody can teach you this, its a self developed skill. Be truly focuses on what you want & don't diverge from it. If you want 10 LPA, go for this, it might take some time, but it will be worth it. But if you gave in to some 6 LPA offer, you will regret later. But if you have some emergency need, then yeah go for it.\n\n\n6. **Things to Avoid-** Avoid jobs which asks for assignment. most of them wont revert back. Avoid any influencer giving 1:1 guidance on Topmate or anywhere else for money. You dont need guidance, you need discipline to go explore the web instead of redirecting to Netflix or P0RN. Avoid companies with bad reviews on glassdoor/ ambitionbox. Many companies dont even have page there, avoid them completely.. Dont only focus on FAANG, many other companies out there. Avoid 6 days or alternate Saturday companies, lol. They will suck your soul! You are a developer, not daily wage nibba!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# My career journey:\n\n1st job- 3.36 LPA (switch after a year, jobless for 1.5 months)\n\n2nd job- 15 LPA (switched after a year, jobless for 4.5 months)\n\nCurrent job- 30 LPA (26 fixed). Fully remote startup. Designation - Senior Software Engineer. (Tech- Node.js, Vue.Js, Mongo, SQL, Redis, Kafka, AWS)\n\nOther offers- 1 was 22 LPA, but was 6 day working. Another was 37 LPA but required relocation. And another was for different tech stack with similar CTC in a Service based company.\n\n# My job search-\n\nOverall it took my 3 active months with lot of mini-breaks to find my job. Overall I applied to  almost 2k jobs.\n\n>Also I wrote scripts to apply on \"button apply\" sites like InstaHyre & hirist & applied to like 15k jobs from them. But I didn't got even 10 responses from these sites.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo after testing out 100's of job sites I mainly went with-\n\nlinkedIn, naukri & wellfound (startups only, require good level of skill). Applied a bit on others too, but they have very low response. You can see my average job hunt experience from attached pic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Job Hunt](https://preview.redd.it/kfvpo3tcm6lc1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d341c8d66383fbcd19ab889019c8c8136856d03)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NOTE:** I have my DM's full of requests from 100+ people & unfortunately I won't be able to reply them. If you have any questions, ask in comments so maybe I or someone else can also answer them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SUPER NOTE**: I could be considered lucky, but I studied like mad till 3/4 AM at nights. Not gave in to depression. And was able to keep on doing it, **thanks my parents support**.\n\n>\"The harder you work, the luckier you get\"",

        "Id": "13fd4tz",
        "Body": "* It is all about mindset. Legally any company that gives you a salary, have to give you exp letter. It is the law as they are cutting income tax from you. So if any company Threatens, find a cheap lawyer sent a notice to your company manager, his manage and the top manager and the HR, her boss and Her boss ka boss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Next, can they screw up my background verification, most likely no, Idea of background verification is whether you worked in the previous company for a set amount period? But your manager can additionally say you are not a good candidate and all. Explain to HR professionally it was a toxic work environment, Remember if you are at the BG verification stage, HR won't risk terminating you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Be confident in your technology, and learn one language, but as you grow, learn all the stages Development, Architecture, Design patterns, Scaling, Cloud deployments, server management etc. You should be devoted to your skill, not to your job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* If faced with a toxic boss, and if you have the tolerance for it or have financial issues and have to stay in the company. Put every work in email, Even the smallest of work assigned, you can summarize your daily work and send it across. This comes in handy at many places like, if you are put in PIP, this is your proof, of your actual quantifiable achievements, they cannot terminate you just like that. If you do not get a hike or the manager asks you what work you did, paste the thread.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* If you can leave a toxic culture always do that, mental peace and WLB should be the main thing in your career, you have to get time to learn new things, you need to relax, and under stress environment, your future growth opportunities are restricted. You cannot find time to learn new stuff and it will be hell overall. The best thing is after you join a company in 3 weeks you'll get to know the culture of the place if it suits you continue else search for another company and leave here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Will there be legal action if I signed a company joining contract and have to compensate them? 99% of the time there will not be an issue, in India right to life or you can say an employee is given better preference over Employer. You have found an opportunity you are taking that, simple. They are not gonna waste time in legal proceedings as they have projects to run and they need to hire engineers ASAP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Always say no to working on weekends or unpaid majdoori. Yes, sometimes it is required to stretch a little bit during production deployment or if something fails. More work is to be given to the person who takes more work. Say No or make other excuses, yea this'll be a deciding factor when it comes to promotion and increments. So here comes the next rule\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Never stay in a company for more than 3 years. This way you do not have to bootlick your way through or work on unreasonable timings, don't need to miss your family time etc. After three years always jump with a good hike. This way even if you have not gotten any hike in your current toxic company you could average your earnings out. Ultimately you are working for your personal development(Skill, money etc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do not think you can change the management by complaining about your boss or any higher-ups. This will ultimately backfire. People especially higher-ups are surviving especially in Indian companies by buttering up to their bosses. They are in fact what you can say the hitman of the management. The management orders are executed by these higher-ups. So until things are very serious your complaint is not gonna do anything\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Upskill, Upskill and start your own freelance practice or company. If you are a passionate developer, regardless of what company you join. Develop your skills, and Have a roadmap where you want to reach. Build something. There is always a negative impression of Indian developers as not being of high quality. We can build quality if we teach, help others and build something of our own. Open source community makes great applications because of this social mindset. So always give back to the community",

After 5 months of initial chemotherapy he is admitted in a Government hospital in Kolkata (NRS medical college) for Autologus bone marrow transplant in 19 OCT, had his operation done in 10th NOV after lots of tests and still in hospital.\n\nNow come to me I am 2023 graduate with [B.Tech](https://b.tech/) degree and was placed in one of the popular serviced based company (Name starts with C) from my college campus.

I will also have to take care of him after he is released form the hospital for at least 3-4 months. My mom is illiterate and does not know about this stuff very much , she also take too much panic even if a slight thing happen. And I have been in contact with all the patient family who are released before all of them has reaction after coming to home. If I leave him it will put his life in great danger.\n\nI have contacted the company via queries many time for office location change but I don't know if it is fault from my side or from them I never got any reply. The joining date is 30 NOV.\n\nSo I am requesting you if you can help me to get a job which pays 15k-20k per months (all for Food and Medicine costs) work from home / anywhere in Kolkata so I can take care of my family at this point of time. I am very much willing to work long hours and also in Saturdays and Sundays. Also I will do swiggy and zomato after work. Also if is a normal desk job I will highly prefer it cause even though I am a Btech graduate since my father diagonisis I lost all touch with codes I tried at some time but could not focus due to mental stress I am going through. And even if you know how to request the company for location change please guide me that path.\n\nI can join the work after 15 Dec as I think my father may be released at that time. Please help me if you can I will be always grateful to you. \n\n(Please forgive all the writing mistakes).",

        "Body": "I was going through the TCS and DXC law suit. I thought we can create this post to tell our juniors and relatively inexperienced freshers that mistakes are not the end of the world. Anyways...\n\n**My worst mistake**\n\nThis was my first job and I was employed  in a startup which was already low on cash.\n\nMy job was to fix a cron job whose responsibility was to automatically renew certain type of licenses after their expiry. To perform this renewal, we had to pay a 3rd party entity.\n\nKeep in mind, this was a startup in crisis with no dev environment, QA team etc. Everything was supposed to be deployed to production straight away. As a developer, I did manage to perform well and therefore was working mostly without supervision.\n\nLong story short, the existing code was awful and I was having a hard time understanding the full logic. As a result, I introduced a seemingly innocent change and inadvertently introduced a bug due to which the service was buying this license multiple times for the same customer.  So, if I needed to buy a license only once for a customer , I was buying it at least 2 and sometimes 3  times for the same customer.\n\n**This resulted in a extra expenditure of 6 lakh INR.**\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nMy manager was a god send and he took the heat. No, I wasn't let go off. I was asked to not repeat this again and I made fully sure to never make a single change, no matter how trivial, without understanding the full context of the code.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMistakes will happen. Its not about *why* its about *when.* What matters is that we don't repeat the same mistake ever again. I recently watched a [goto conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9clBHENy4Q) where the speaker talked about his mistakes and a developer and also other famous mistakes in software. I would encourage every one to watch it once   \n\n\nCheers :)\n\n&#x200B;",

        "Body": "So recently my father got diagnosed from cancer and i had to leave my job in February for his treatment and he is doing fine now.I started (23 M)  looking for a job from July, cleared 4 companies but all ghosted (i don't know why they do it). Then i decided that I'll take some time to upskill myself and then start applying. Since then there's nothing in my life apart from coding and i really enjoy it. I get this dopamine hit from coding which further motivates me but the thing is that I'm leaving everything behind and I'm not even thinking about them. Like i recently had a break up with my gf (5 year long relationship) but i felt nothing, no grief nothing, never cried. Only felt bad when I'm not doing coding and as soon as i sit for coding, it feels like fuck everything. \n\nIt may sound good for now but I'm pretty sure that i gonna regret later in my life for not doing anything besides coding. The only thing which i wanna do apart from coding is travelling but I can't afford it for now because of financial problems which again motivates me for coding because that will solve these financial problems. Is someone there who felt this way and how did you dealt with it?\n\n\n\nEdit: People who think this is good (received some comments and DMs saying that), that is not at all true. Discipline makes everything good. There is a very thick line between passion and having only one thing in life to do. I even said that I'm going to regret later in life that i did nothing besides coding. Please don't force yourself into this. Good luck to everyone",

        "Title": "My Kyndryl manager gave me (life changing) shock of my life",
        "Id": "1ag32f2",
        "Body": "I have 15+ yrs of experience in IT industry and was working as a cloud architect in the delivery team for a SaaS application where engineering and product management teams failed to deliver any useful feature which can make customers subscribe to or buy this application outside of the existing customer base of the company.\n\nSaved two big accounts by implementing some features in a very short time which these customers were looking for in this application and which were supposed to be developed by the engineering team. As usual engineering and product management teams were always busy planning that next innovative feature which no customer wanted. Came to know after leaving the team that these two customers have terminated the contract because engineering could not deliver the features which they were looking for despite having better resources than the solution engineering team and giving them much better hike from time to time.\n\nOne fine day, I came to know through an email that I will be moving to CMC (a fancy name for the bench) from the very next day. There was no prior communication in this regard by either of my managers (in-country and global) where one is based in India and other one is based in US. That too after working in this project for more than five years and guiding all the solution engineers and junior cloud architects throughout my time in this team when many of them were not even working in the accounts where I was the offshore cloud architect. Saw how many people, who were moved to CMC, were struggling to get the next role (especially band 8 and above) and so decided to pursue the entrepreneurship to work on an idea which was not letting me sleep for past many months and to reduce the competition for the folks in CMC who were on the same band as me. CMC was an eye-opening experience for me where I realized that how important it is for people like me to come out of our comfort zone and help in creating jobs. Entrepreneurship is very\u00a0tough (especially for the first-time entrepreneurs) but the sheer idea of creating jobs (especially for those who are struggling in this market) is what is keeping me motivated and helping me to navigate this tough time with ease.\n\nSent an email to India HR leader complaining in this regard and a senior executive of the delivery organization who is skip manager of my manager. While HR leader replied promptly and asked one of her reportees to investigate this, delivery executive didn't even bother to reply. Reportee of the HR leader who spoke to me was more interested in showing sympathy to me than looking into my complaint. He asked me to look outside when I told him that there is hardly any opening at my band level. He told me that he will come back to me after a few days but that never happened. Few days before leaving the organization, I asked them what action they took on my complaint and then only they forwarded my complaint to Employee Concerns team. Again, a person spoke to me, collected all the details but nothing happened after that. Dropped an email to CHRO, CTO and the group president of Kyndryl **but no one bothered to reply (was NOT expecting a response from anyone other than CHRO) although the email clearly mentioned in the subject that this action of my India/US managers could have been life threating for me**. So, all those sugar-coated talks of taking employee concerns seriously are just on paper and nothing is taken seriously.\u00a0\n\nI'm not sure how it is in other service based companies but in our team, we found that people with 15+ years of experience were working with freshers or people with less than 2 yrs of experience. It is quite opposite to what I had seen in the beginning of my career where you used to have a mix of freshers, senior engineers, team leads and architects. So now you are supposed to learn the stuff which IMO people should learn on their own and teach this to the junior resources (where many have no desire to learn the stuff on their own) at an age when you were planning to focus more on your kids' education. It became so frustrating that I started doing most of the stuff on my own instead of giving work to these junior resources to have a peaceful life.\u00a0\n\nLesson learnt and message to the folks at my experience level and freshers/junior resources -\n\n* I used to be critical of the people who are changing jobs frequently because this is making life miserable for technical folks like me who have to teach same stuff to people from time to time who come to office just to make some money but hardly have any desire to learn anything on their own. But not anymore. So please keep on switching job whenever you get an opportunity as you have only 10-15 years to make as much money as possible under hostile managers and brainless leadership.\n* No one cares for your life. So, take it easy at work instead of working like a workaholic which is what I have seen in case of many technical folks. Show is running even though many are working for namesake, doing nothing productive and surviving on your work.\u00a0 Learn to be like them.\n* If your manager is a person from a different world then look for a job somewhere else. A supporting and caring manager is very much needed for a successful career in this industry. My India manager, who is the director of delivery as well, will come to office just to sit in a corner meeting room and hardly have any interaction with the team. We had hardly any useful interaction since he became the director more than two years back.\n* Life becomes miserable when you have engineering and product management teams which are implementing every feature other than what customers want, a hostile devops team which is hell bent on using ci/cd to delay the code by weeks which your customers are expecting in few days, infrastructure architects (working on VMware stuff) who pretend to be busy and find every reason not to come to the meetings or try to hide as much as possible from you. I could achieve only 25% of what I could have achieved otherwise thanks to all these folks/teams. So, if you think that you will not be able to navigate such complex environment then delivery is NOT for you.\n\nFinally, I believe that service-based companies can do at least 40% better than these companies are doing currently and create many more jobs. But some people who have no desire to grow, surviving on other people's work or have no idea how to lead a workforce where people are being asked to go for a certification every quarter without any project to apply these skills will keep on taking these companies towards a dark future.",

It's just a glorified and verbose Google if you will! As the engineer Rancho says in 3 idiots movie, *\"anything that makes your job easier is a machine\"*. AI is just a machine with natural language processing feature, that's all. It doesn't mean it's any more useful or different than the millions of other machines we are surrounded by.\n\nFor all the popularity and rage ChatGPT has gained in last 1-2 months, how many human problems does it actually solve? Even the crappiest version of Microsoft Excel from the late 1990s is more useful as a tool or machine than today's ChatGPT. Google search is another useful tool which points you to resources with the information you're looking for.\n\nThings like a spreadsheet or search engine are ideal machines. This is what machines are built for, to assist humans in their tasks and be subservient to them, not to intimidate or throw sarcasm or innuendos at them like ChatGPT does!\n\nThe ChatGPT hype generated few months ago is now gradually subsiding as one can see. But in case it doesn't, remember that programmers are the last people an AI will ever replace. There are much easier tasks, more low hanging fruits, which will be taken long before IT jobs. For example, writers or bloggers are being replaced by AI is what you often here, clerks and accountants is another example. But mind you, AI is just going to do the basic grunt work or crude calculations here, present day AI cannot replace a Chartered Accountant!",

        "Id": "1aofxfb",
        "Body": "I have been developing software for enterprises and lately startups all through my life. I graduated from IIT Kharagpur in 2002 and started with a services company with pay packet of Rs. 3Lakh per annum. In those days it was considered a great offer. In less than 2 years after graduation, I started working as a freelancer as I found working in a job too stifling.\n\nI witnessed good growth in my career. All through these 22 years I have been a \"hands on\" software developer. I never ventured to the management side at all. I was pretty much able to upgrade my skills and get work on technologies that were in demand with change in times. Today I look back and see that I was never out of work. Even in crash of 2008 or midst covid pandemic on 2020, I always had some or the other project work going on.\n\nI never left India or for that mater even the city which I called home after graduation. I never needed to leave India. Freelancing, which gave me lot of freedom to choose the technologies and projects I want to work on, was pretty rewarding financially too. Until recently I was able to work my way upto annual earnings of close to Rs 1 cr. Given from where I started, I would have never had this kind of growth had I stayed a software developer/engineer in some or the other IT job.\n\nI never had inclination towards management, I found making presentations and reports boring and never had the knack of getting involved in office politics or managing people. So to say I was pretty satisfied work wise all these 22 years.\n\nGenerally speaking careers in IT are short lived. By the time you are in mid 40s, unless you like doing software development, pyramid is pretty steep to thrive in the management world. I always knew that and managed my finances accordingly, so today I can say that I am comfortably placed.\n\nHowever being in mid 40s its first time I am thinking of what to do next. My current projects seem to have all gotten over abruptly due to all the slowdown the tech sector is facing. First time in 22 years I wondering if I am still employable. Have I simply out priced myself. \n\nI never thought I would be out of work, after all I am very good at what I do and I have a good education or degree to back my skills. However in todays software development market I am not so sure. Wondering for the first time whats next for me. Am I in for a long break which I may need or I continue to chug along for another 20 years?\n\nHave a good one folks!",

        "Title": "ZOHO called around 500+ candidates onsite for 2023 grads and selected none.",
        "Id": "16d30pz",
        "Body": "TLDR:\nI attended September off-campus on-site drive ZOHO at Chennai.\n\n- Round 1: Aptitude and C. (1hour) shortlisted 26 people out of 500+.\n- Round 2: Basic Coding. (1hour,4questions) shortlisted 13 out of 26. (for questions read the long post)\n- Round 3: Advanced Coding. (1hour,3 questions) shortlisted 9 out of 13. (for questions read the long post)\n- Round 4: Console Application. (1question) (for question read the long post)\n\t- Part1: (3hours) shortlisted 4 out of 9.\n\t- Part2: (3hours) rejected all. (yes I was one of them).\n\nRumors says they filled the position through referral.\n\nLong Post:\n\nI attended September off-campus on-site drive at their ZOHO office Chennai. This hiring was there for developer position in their ZOHO mail team.\n\n### Round 1: Aptitude + C\n\n- Happened on 2nd September at 11:30 to 12:30 AM in their parking space.\n- 10 basic aptitude and 15 C coding/output related questions. No multiple choice, you are supposed to write correct answer in front page.\n- The results were declared after half an hour and only 26 people were shortlisted. Rejected candidates were told to leave and try again after 6 months.\n \nMy opinion: I don't find it practical at all to call candidates in large numbers to just reject them immediately on spot. People have to spend time, energy and money to come to these drives. I could feel the disappointment in the air when they announced the shortlist. Seeing those many hopeless faces was not cool. It's clear from their actions that they want best out of best so why don't just call worthy candidates.\n\n### Round 2: Basic Coding\n\n- This round happened after lunch the same day, I don't remember the time but it went for 1 hour. All the further rounds were supposed to be coded on their systems only.\n\n- The following questions were asked with links\n\n[268. Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)\n\n[171. Excel Sheet Column Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-number/)\n\nI don't have link to 3rd problem so here is the statement, there are two words, secret word and guess word, for each letter in guess word if it matches exactly with secret letter print g, if letter is present at different position print y, if letter is not present at all print -(hyphen).\n\nExample - \nsecret - BRICK guess - BLOCK, output = g--gg\n\n[392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)\n\n- Since all questions are easy rated, this round can be cleared with basic knowledge of coding.\n\n- Us 13 candidates went to next round.\n\n### Round 3: Advanced Coding\n\n- This round again happened on same day and we were given 1 hour to code.\n\n- The following questions were asked with links\n\n[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)\n\n[2428. Maximum Sum of an Hourglass](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-an-hourglass/)\n\n[1525. Number of Good Ways to Split a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-ways-to-split-a-string/)\n\n- Us 9 candidates went to next round\n\nMy Opinion - if they had to shorTlist few people out of small number of people then why don't directly ask these medium level question. Anyways\n\n### Round 4: Console Application\n\n- Only one problem statement was given, I have given gist of statEment below.\n\n### Part 1: \n\n- This round happened on 7th September, we were called at morning 9:30. The round went from 10:30 to 2:00 PM. \n- During this round 5 candidates were informed to leave.\n\n### Part 2:\n- This round went from 3:00 to around 6:00, we were told to continue implementing the same problem statement. \n- The issue was that problem statement was not very clear with requirements and the invigilators themselves couldn't come up with a valid explanation for the input and output cases.\n- By 5 PM my soul had already left the body but we were still implementing what we can.\n\n**Problem statement:**\nImplement Parking lot system that is responsible for assigning floor and slots for cars and maintain a queue for cars. (Sounds simple right, you have not read the functional requirements)\n\nBelow I have just mentioned modules we worked with\n\n- Car registration module.\n- User registration module.\n- Parking system module. \n- Cost calculation module.\n- Report registration module. \n\n### Finally\n\nBy 6 PM they informed they are not moving forward and we were informed to leave. I talked with another candidate who had appeared multiple times. The rumor I got from inside is that they hired through referral.",

        "Title": "The non-leetcode answer to \"How do I crack the interview\"",
        "Id": "16cgfy7",
        "Body": "TL;DR: Open Source development kick started my career despite being a college dropout and I think it is a great way to impress your interviewer.\n\nHi everyone. I have been watching the posts at r/developersindia since at least two years. I do comment and partake in discussions as well using another ID. Before I proceed, let me first introduce myself.\n\nI am [Vaibhav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhavkaushal/), a middle-aged (35+ yrs old) man working in the IT industry since 10+ years (but doing software development since more than 14 years now). I have been a FullStack (Web+Backend) + DevOps guy since the beginning but am mostly backend-heavy these days. In the past I have written for a few Tech Magazines which includes Digit, CHIP and Linux for You. I started the journey with the security domain so I do have some basic knowledge around that too. I have been one of the core developers of a PHP framework in the past (named QCubed) which has been used at NASA, Stanford School of Medicine and was the framework in which the world\u2019s largest Chess community site (Chess.com) was originally written.\n\nNow, back to the point. One of the most (if not THE most) frequently asked questions on this sub is about how to get into a job (aka \"how to crack the interview\"). I have been taking interviews since the start of career (10+ years) and have been on both sides of the table. So I believe I am qualified to offer some insight into the process and offer help on this topic.\n\nMost people think Leetcode is THE DEFINITIVE ANSWER. Sorry to state but that's NOT TRUE. I have worked with a couple of guys who were champions in competitive coding and honestly they were bad with everything else and that's a huge problem. Now Leetcode (or similar sites) are useful in training your mind to think in better ways. They teach you to think in innovative ways and make you proficient in basics of DSA. But honestly, in my career so far I never had to write a merge sort or invert a tree; never.\n\nSo what do people look for in candidates? Unless you are trying for MMAANG, where DSA skills is mostly a filtering mechanism, you don't need the god level expertise with DSA. What impresses me (and a lot of other guys taking interviews) is \"experience\".\n\nSo now you must be thinking \"but I need a job or at least a meaningful internship to get experience\". And that's where most people, at least in my observation on this sub, are wrong.\n\nWhen we look for candidates, we look for people who can solve problems in innovative ways; people who have the ability to go deep into a subject and find out why a bug exists; someone who already knows how to handle git; a guy who knows that part of the job of writing the software is to read other people's code and understand why something was done in a certain way; someone who understands that documentation is pretty important. I expect him to know the basics of the environment where his code will work (browsers for FE, Kubernetes/Cloud/VM for BE) and so on, what it will interact with (REST APIs, gRPC, GraphQL, Auth mechanisms for FE and DB, Cache, Logging frameworks etc. for BE).\n\nNONE of that needs you to have an internship or job. If someone has put up a profile with some experience with an existing Open Source project or has built something cool that solves a real problem, it catches my eye. Regardless of other factors, the desire of me wanting to talk to him is pretty high.\n\nNow, if you built a Library management system (or something similar) using 10 files in Python, I am sure no one is using that and such software are already there. You have zero visibility into how many use-cases are lacking, what the real-world bugs are in the code and so on. It probably cannot handle enough traffic and is organised poorly. So basically I am looking for \"meaningful work\" - whether you contributed a small feature or fixed a bug in Kubernetes or made a Logging library which is super easy to integrate and use, you are experienced with the domain in a meaningful way. You\n\n- must have some insight into code organisation\n- must be knowing fundamentals of git\n- must be knowing how to structure to your code\n- must have decent communication skills\n- must have read through and understood basic documentation related to the subject\n- must be (very important) passionate about solving an existing problem\n\nAll of this is \"experience\" that makes my life easy as a senior/lead developer. It tells me that you, as a junior/colleague, would not need hand holding on basic stuff and that I can count on you to understand the dozens of dependencies on existing codebase and its functionality. Of course it does not mean that you should skip on DSA or that DSA is useless! DSA is still very much required, although being a DSA god is not required for most things we do in the software world!\n\nNow, I have had a few ideas since quite some time and recently I came in touch with a few members of this sub and started collaborating on those ideas. A couple of those are being actively developed.\n\nOne of them is a developer tools utility and is accessible at https://devta.techrail.in (apologies, site might be down as I am working on the server to dockerize all apps for portability). It is like DevUtils (https://devutils.com/) but is a web-app (loads in the browser) and does all calculations on the browser itself. It does not (and must not in future) send any data to any backend to get the stuff done. It is a work in progress but 8 out of 10 tools developed so far are working flawlessly.\n\nAnother is a project for an open source password manager (like LastPass or Bitwarden, but open source) which uses the user\u2019s Google Drive to store and sync the passwords. It does not have a backend and is not supposed to have one. We are starting work on the iOS mobile app and have initialized the Android app too. We are going to need the Browser Extensions in future as well. Here is a screenshot from an earlier build (we have the mocks ready).\n\nIn addition we have some backend-focused projects planned as well - from logging library to file server to proxy projects. We are a small bunch (this includes u/3649RIO, u/computermakeswaffle, u/Agent474real and others) but we are chugging along; improving our profiles while also solving some problems that exist.\n\nMy career got a kickstart despite being a college dropout because of my open source contribution profile and I think it is something that matters a lot (having been on both sides I can attest to that). I hope at least some of you would understand this point.\n\nWe have a discord server where we discuss/chat about the work (and sometimes share memes too), hold a discussion every weekday at 9 PM to share our progress across projects and share and learn things from one another. So if you are interested in working on some meaningful open-source projects (for improving the profile and gaining experience), you can join our discord and we can talk about what interests you and start off with a relevant project. GitHub org link is https://github.com/techrail \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: I don\u2019t plan to create an Instagram/Facebook page, Twitter handle or SubReddit for this. All we have is the Discord server for discussions specific to the projects/apps we want to build. It is not a place for getting generic help around coding, or resume reviews or leetcode hints (for that you have r/developersindia and its discord server). Our Discord server is focused on the Open Source development work on the selected projects, so please join only if you are interested in doing the development/testing work.\n\nEDIT: A number of you joined. The post has gained more popularity than I anticipated. It only shows that most of us want to do something but don\u2019t know where to start and/or what to do. Those of you who have joined and want more details - I will try to post some readmes, create channels and repositories and categorise stuff. Please join the daily call in the evening (9PM). Thank you again!",

        "Id": "1bj9cea",
        "Body": "I was part of an interview panel for a staff data science role. The candidate had written a really impressive resume with lots of domain specific project work experience about creating and deploying cutting-edge ML products. They had even mentioned the ROI in millions of dollars. The candidate started talking endlessly about the ML models they had built, the cloud platforms they'd used to deploy, etc. But then, when other panelists dug in, the candidate could not answer some domain specific questions they had claimed extensive experience for. So it was just like any other interview.\n\nOne panelist wasn't convinced by the resume though. Turns out this panelist had been a consultant at the company where the candidate had worked previously, and had many acquaintances from there on LinkedIn as well. She texted one of them asking if the claims the candidate was making were true. According to this acquaintance, the candidate was not even part of the projects they'd mentioned on the resume, and the ROI numbers were all made up. Turns out the project team had once given a demo to the candidate's team on how to use their ML product.\n\nWhen the panelist shared this information with others on the panel, the candidate was rejected and a feedback was sent to the HR saying the candidate had faked their work experience.\n\nThis isn't the first time I've come across people \"plagiarizing\" (for the lack of a better word) others' project works as their's during interview and in resumes. But this incident was wild. But do you think a deserving and more eligible candidate misses an opportunity everytime a fake resume lands at your desk? Should HR do a better job filtering resumes?\n\nEdit 1: Some have asked if she knew the whole company. Obviously not, even though its not a big company. But the person she connected with knew about the project the candidate had mentioned in the resume. All she asked was whether the candidate was related to the project or not. Also, the candidate had already resigned from the company, signed NOC for background checks, and was a immediate joiner, which is one of the reasons why they were shortlisted by the HR. \n\nEdit 2: My field of work requires good amount of domain knowledge, at least at the Staff/Senior role, who're supposed to lead a team. It's still a gamble nevertheless, irrespective of who is hired, and most hiring managers know it pretty well. They just like to derisk as much as they can so that the team does not suffer. As I said the candidate's interview was just like any other interview except for the fact that they got caught. Had they not gone overboard with exxagerating their  experience, the situation would be much different.",

About a year ago more than half of team left the company(including the manager) due to the company forcing the team to resign. Fortunately I wasn't one of them. The company then hired new manager and let me tell you, he doesn't know anything about coding and the only certificate he have is scrum certificate. They hired him because he was ready to work even for 20k/month. \nAfter getting comfortable around 8 month or so on his job he started mentally abusing the team. Taking \"sessions\" for 4hrs a day of single person and just berating them and putting my team members on PIP. He is assigning person with C# knowledge to create a react application, if they can't create it in 2 weeks he will kick them out of the company.I tried to talk the management but it backfired to me and now I am on his list too. \nWhat can I do in this situation.\nEdit: I forgot to even mention that he created a new rule where we can't bring our phone in the building and have to submit them to watch guard's office. So even if I get calls from other companies, I couldn't answer them and I can't even call them back because they don't take incoming calls ",

        "Body": "Hello!\n\nI'm (29M) lucky enough to have received a job offer from an established company in Berlin. The role would come with relocation support to Germany for myself and my wife. I wanted to understand what people think of our situation and maybe get some help figuring out whether this move would be right for us.\n\nJust a note on my spouse. She works and earns about 12L a year in India. However, she's terribly burnt out and depressed due to the nature of her work (non-profits, outreach field work, etc.). Hence, we've decided that she'll be taking a career break for a year. That's something I insisted on, since her mental health and wellbeing is my priority, and I couldn't have done any of this without her support.\n\n### Background\nLet's just get this out of the way, since I'm sure many people will ask me about my qualifications.\n\n* 7 YoE in software development (full-stack)\n* 2 patents filed and granted from the USPTO\n* Bachelors in ECE from a well-known university in India\n\n### The Berlin Offer\n\n* Fixed salary of 90,000 EUR per annum\n* Hybrid working model (2 days in office)\n* One month's stay in a managed apartment in Berlin\n* 7000 EUR for relocation support (flights, logistics, etc.)\n* 30 days of PTO\n* 30 days of WFA (Work From Abroad; includes India)\n* The best paternity benefits (since Europe)\n\nHow did I apply here? I applied on their website. That's literally it. And I'm sorry, there's no magic bullet to getting shortlisted.\n\nI have the following competing offers that I have tentatively accepted. All the names have been slightly altered. But you can probably find them all with a bit of intelligent Googling.\n\n### ShadyTM\n\nI'd get to work on adtech and marketing-tech software here. The scale that they operate on is amazing. However, the general working culture is very \"desi\". The role is remote and since we live with my parents, I'd save 80% of my salary. So that's something.\n\n* Fixed salary of 45L per annum, 1L Joining Bonus, 1L retention bonus. 47L for the first year\n* Fully remote till the end of the year\n* 3000 stocks vested over 5 years (back loaded vesting, only 30% in the first two years)\n* Each stock is valued today at Rs. 838 (this is a listed company). Total stock value is about 25L\n* 12 CL, 1.25 PL per month, 1 day for anniversary/birthday (28 days PTO)\n* 5 days paternal leave\n\n### Exactly, Believe Data\n\nThe work is boring and average. Growth and learning seems limited. The benefits are good. The working culture seems good. That's about it. Very rest-and-vest-oriented company with lots of focus on processes, etc.\n\n* Fixed salary of 42L per annum, 8% annual performance bonus. About 45L per annum\n* Fully remote. Period.\n* 12 CL, 2 PL per month (36 days PTO)\n* 1 month paternal leave\n\nSo that's about it. My main question about the international offer is obviously whether it's enough to sustain two people comfortably. I'm aware our savings rate would not be as much as in India. Would the QoL in the EU be a worthy trade-off?\n\nEdit: I've decided to not go to Berlin. The savings rate at a remote job in India is easily 4x that of Berlin. Thank you all for your insight.",

A Bengaluru startup (16 LPA)(12 base, 3ESOPS, 1other)\n\nDuring my college days, I used to encourage my friends to do competitive programming and data structures and algorithms (DSA), but they were all too busy with their college lives. I knew that if I didn't do DSA or competitive programming, I would end up with no job offer, so I started learning on my own.\n\nI started with GeeksForGeeks (GFG) and then moved on to LeetCode. I wasn't able to do competitive programming on Codeforces, so I gave up on that and focused on DSA on LeetCode. I also did a lot of development projects to get an internship.\n\nIn my final year, I got an internship offer from a Bengaluru startup (45K stipend) and later received a pre-placement offer (PPO) from the same startup(16LPA).\n\nSince I was from a tier-3 college, I struggled to find a good teacher. I wanted to explore more in the field of computer science, so I decided to join the big tech giant (6.5 LPA) which was offering an MTech program.\n\nBefore joining, I thought that the teachers would be very good and would teach in-depth. However, the reality is that they are the same as tier-3 teachers. They just read the slides and don't go into depth. I was expecting a lot from the teachers, and maybe there was something wrong with me.\n\nNow, I regret declining the startup offer. My main purpose for joining the company was to do an MTech and explore more CS concepts in depth.\n\n**Let me know if there is something wrong with me.**",

        "Id": "150tzg6",
        "Body": "OpenAI introduced their new project called [Superalignment](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment?ref=generatived.com) lead by Ilya Sutskevar and Jan Leike, the timeline they have given themselves is of 4 years to fundamentally control these superintelligent agents. The blog says, \"While superintelligence seems far off now, we believe it could arrive this *decade*\". Since OpenAI is one of the labs that works very closely with cutting edge models, we can clearly see that it's not anymore a matter of speculation at this point.   \n\n\nBefore going ahead what I am going to say has a lot of speculative thoughts, keep that in mind. To get started let's define what Singularity is, The Singularity is the inflection point where Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) surpasses human intelligence. Beyond this point, growth in intelligence is unpredictable, but it's likely to be far from linear \u2014 potentially exponential (envision an [e\\^x graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function#Graph), where time is on the x-axis and intelligence, or IQ, is on the y-axis, although keep in mind humans are quite bad at experiencing exponential functions biologically). The bigger question here is how would you measure the \"IQ\" of a super intelligence, when do we say that Singularity has arrived exactly?   \n\n\nModels as of now are not able to solve any fundamental mathematical or physics problems (as far as what's open in public) but you can see the early very early signs of mathematical superiority with  [AlphaTensor](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/discovering-novel-algorithms-with-alphatensor) to discovering faster [sorting algorithms](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphadev-discovers-faster-sorting-algorithms). These problems are fundamental to mathematics and computing where humans historically made advances in a more staged manner. For me the cutoff would be solving extremely hard problems such as [P=NP?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem), [proof of Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture), [solving current problems with the Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_beyond_the_Standard_Model#Problems_with_the_Standard_Model), and so on.  \n\n\nOnce it arrives, the impacts are going to be far fetched, let's say for the sake of argument it solves fundamental problems in [Quantum Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#Quantum_gravity) and breaks the barrier that is poised by classic transistors, the compute power would be exponential, since the system is designed solely based on making [mathematical optimizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function), optimization becomes a function of raw innovation and nothing else, and manipulations can even be done at sub atomic levels breaking the known physical barriers. Why would AGI care about human morality when models are rewarded based on a mathematical loss function at its core ([reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback) based rewards does exists but in case AGI arrives why would it care about feedback from humans over hyper optimization). I think a possible approach might be mathematically define systems that abstracts away and represents human morality in a symbolic way or in way it becomes a [differentiable function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function) over multiple parameters, and create a competing agents as powerful as SOTA AGI in future  which can act as observers to AGI systems with sole goal to optimize the \"morality functions\". Although the fundamental issue remains how you would decide what morality is?   \n\n\nIn worst case scenario we don't reach to system which can objectively counter AGI and enforces human values, it's quite incomprehensible at this point as to what the limitations are. If we consider our physics based models to be way we analyse (but not completely manipulate) fundamental reality, are there any chances that AGI can come up with a simulated environment where the rules of physics are defined and can be manipulated. Since, at its core [replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_recursive_function) of AGI becomes trivial task and mathematical optimization is the only goal what's the upper bound in terms of raw resources, but again if hypothetically rules of physics can be manipulated theoretically there is no limit on physical resources.   \n\n\nMoreover lets say we are just solving all the problems in this world with the help of AGI, lets ask a more fundamental problem, are there infinite problems to be solved? Logically speaking if we only consider set of decision problems then there are infinite problems that are undecidable but still there are enough infinite problems that are [decidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_(logic)) and are not solved, so we may actually never run out of problems to be solved. Where does this stop? Lets say that according to the mathematical systems that we have developed is [incomplete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems), which means there will be statements that cannot be proven either true or false using the rules of that system. There must be a possibility that AI can come up with a Logical framework that is beyond human comprehension and is not fundamentally based on [Axiomatic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system), thus making the mathematics complete (I know its a very huge thing to say), but we do not really know what's coming.",

As someone who is from a tier 3 college myself and earns (not bad) in India, I believe I can provide you resources and skills that can change the way our people progress in tech. I strongly believe that money should flow in from other countries into India, and not just keep rotating between Indian companies itself. \n\ni have a good locus standi amongst trainers from Microsoft, Google, HPE, Amazon, VMWare and RedHat. If i ask them to take a session or 2 for free, they will oblige without any problem. How many of you would be interested? \n\nLet me know the topics that will benefit you, and i will try arranging them. \n\nSome topics- \n\n1. Programming languages \n2. Cloud \n3.

During this time, I extensively studied OS, OOPS, and C++ concepts.\n\nDuring the interviews, I faced 2 coding questions, along with questions on operating systems and OOPs in C++. I managed to answer nearly all of them, but stumbled on some basics of networking.\n\nIn the end, I felt I performed decently, but unfortunately, I wasn't selected. Reflecting on this, I realized that I failed to make a memorable impression on the interviewers and came across as too generic.\n\nI've been using Linux for the past 2 years and have a comprehensive understanding of the operating system. Additionally, I've dabbled in OpenGL, GLFW, and libraries like Raylib. I'm also deeply interested in hardware APIs like DirectX and Wine, and have knowledge in these areas. However, I neglected to mention any of this during the interview. Despite preparing well for OS and C++, I missed the opportunity to steer the conversation towards these topics, namely OS, C++ and Linux. Instead, I simply answered the questions as they were asked.\n\nIt would have been less stressful knowing I could potentially work for one of my dream companies with a great salary. This surely is going to haunt me for quite some time, but lesson learnt I guess. ",

I couldn't get a part-time job in the first semester because every position was filled with references before my application could make an impact. In the next two semesters, I joined a 20-hour Data Engineering role, which is an entry-level position, but they weren't willing to offer me a full-time position. Now, I have an internship, working 40 hours a week. The team is good, the work is fine, but the salary I would receive here is at least 20% less than what US employees make. The work is pretty relaxed, and if you are, for example, an Azure/GCP Data Engineer in India with a good understanding of Python, Spark, SQL, and Databricks, you will find it very easy here.\n\nThere are tens of thousands of Indian students here who completed their 1-year or 2-year Data Analytics/Big Data courses from diploma colleges. Most of them will find it challenging to get a job here. Many came to Canada without experience back home or came from 3-year undergraduate courses (BCA, BSC). For an entry-level Power BI role in our company, there are hundreds of applicants, all of them completed Business Management/Analytics/Data Analytics courses without any verifiable experience. All these individuals were sold a dream of a fancy course at an unknown college, and they are struggling to break into the industry. I have seen more resumes from students with a BSC in Mathematics and Data Analytics from St. Clair College than from students with master's degrees. So, if you're planning to join one of these courses from these colleges, think about it again. It's always better to go to a university and work your way up instead of spending 18-22 lakhs on PG diplomas.\n\nIf you're experienced, have savings, and want to move to Canada, yes, you will find a job, but the salaries will be very low, and the work won't be very challenging. You won't be learning much. The market feels oversaturated now, and yes, references do help a lot, but there is good demand for senior and mid-level positions. For those roles, if you consider purchasing power parity (PPP), Indian salaries aren't that bad. I am not sure what I will do in the future because the salary I earn won't be enough for a family/house/big investment back home. Master's degrees are good, and you will learn a lot, but if you're experienced, I suggest you take the PR route and move to Canada.",

        "Id": "15217go",
        "Body": "In the past few weeks, I have seen a ton of posts floating around asking how to get call-backs or land internships. I was once sailing the same boat, so hopefully this post helps some of you to navigate these murky waters.\n\nSo I got a rank around 30k in my JEE and landed a CS degree in a Tier-3 college. Didn't have that strong of a financial background, so had to settle with this. Thankfully I had some good college seniors, so I got into Competitive Programming in my first year itself. I had a knack for Mathematics since school time, so I enjoyed CP as well.  \nThen covid hit as I entered my second year, this gave me a ton of free time. So I was solving CP problems all day long for two years. This help me built a really good coding profile. I was applying for some teaching internships at this time and landed a great educational part-time thing. They recently raised a funding so they were paying crazy good. All I had to was make videos around DSA, and paid off my college fee and invested a lot into stocks and wasted some on CSGO skins. As for my developer profile, I just did some small projects on MERN Stack, some python scripting and participated in SIH ( couldn't go onsite due to some complications. ), so probably most of you have more development experience than me.  \n\n\nI was also actively looking for development related internships from Telegram etc. I filled 100's of applications with no callbacks. The only thing that you can do at this point is Fill and Forget. Don't expect a callback, it will just lower your morale down. I randomly gave a HackerEarth contest which was for an internship and just forgot about it. I checked after the deadline was over and no results were published. So I just posted on Linkedin tagging the company and Hackerearth. Funnily enough, Hackerearth replied and I got the mail for interview few hours after.  \n\n\nThe interview was a cakewalk. Landed a 6-month internship and now have converted it into a PPO. The company has great culture, flexible work hours, hybrid WFH, and a good salary as well. Quite lucky to land this, also I think those 2 years of hard work paid off. I also cleared OAs for DE Shaw and Paypal, but the roles were closed/filled due to recession. All you can do is try in my opinion. If I can do it, you guys can do it too. Adios.",

If you have an offer with WITCH, join and look for other opportunities, in ur probation period (first 6 months) your notice period is just a month, so if you find a better job, switch immediately.

You bet!  \nM1 had arranged a 1:1. HR was in the room. Gave the regular pitch of role being made redundant, not related to performance, blah blah. It was shocking. I was hoping this was the worst. It wasn't.\n\nFirst the good part. 3 months base pay. 1 year medical post that. Help from an external agency. And 2-3 months severance pay too. Thank you for this.\n\nNow the bad part. I was told to resign on the spot. Not share with anyone that I am managed out. I was not even supposed to tell this to my M2. My M1 would be telling others that I resigned out of choice. The shitty part is even after so many days, no one, absolutely none from my team has reached out to me - upon enquiring I was told my reportees and peers were told not to contact those \"managed out\". Shitty behavior. Not even HR or M2 reached out later to check my mental well-being - how is one of their good employees coping up with the layoff. Disgusting.\n\nWhy am I saying this as hypocrisy? Because MS values and culture and what Satya says is diagonally different from what happened with me (probably others too) in India/Noida. I have read LinkedIn posts where impacted folks were treated well by their managers, M2s were empathetic and shared job openings from elsewhere, were in touch after the resignation, other internal openings were passed on to them, it really felt as if they were honored and the separation was painful. For me here, HR and my M1 were shitty and cold as hell. I was treated like a parasite. I expected this in a lousy company - MS Noida HR and my M1 behavior has proven that no matter what the ethics and tenets and other values they cry hoarse about, when it comes to giving bad news, they are at par with other shitty companies.

However the problem is that even if they give you a 60-70% hike what's the guarantee that you will stay back. What's stopping you from switching. However the guy they replace you with from outside has to complete at least a year or even more. That's why the company doesn't give a damn.",

I'm kinda attached to the workplace (near to home, good friends etc). How to beat this?\n3. As it is a US based company, they don't provide PF, experience certificate, payslips etc. How hard it would be to switch back to an Indian company in the future?\n4. Different tech stack but they are ready to provide full training. Currently working as MERN developer but they are using PHP, laravel, react, Ionic, postgresql, mysql, aws and gcp\nSo guys, I definately need your inputs regarding this\n\nEDIT: Many are asking me how I got a remote opportunity. The answer is simple I found it on indeed. I selected a particular non popular City for openings in remote web dev roles. In my case the listing was only for remote US developers but I contacted the company through their mail and asked for just 35% of what they were offering. I showed my full portfolio of projects. They agreed and scheduled interviews. All went smooth. 1 small take home assessment, 2 technical rounds, 1 management round. Zero DSA(I don't even know anything about it though \ud83e\udd23) all questions were based on basics, projects based, scenario based and system design based.",

A few comments\n* For people saying a lot of SWEs are underpaid - 100%, I agree but this post doesn't cater to them.\n* SWE's work hard and deserve these high salaries- Again, I never said that its an ethical correction, a lot of folks deserve what they earn. Its a purely financial correction\n* To personal trolls in comments/messages- Do better friends, there is a civil way of discussion- hope you learn that, have a nice day :)\n************************************************\n\nThe fact (which lot of people don't want to admit) is that a lot of software engineers are overpaid in India and there is a clear reason for that\n\nWhen the startup bubble of India happened (2019-2021) , there were a lot of companies who gained a lot of funding. And basically, everyone of them wanted software engineers. \n\nThis meant competition for each and every good engineer, leading to offer-shopping and an auction of sort which pushed software salaries to an extreme. Other companies had to keep up, and so the overall figures increased drastically. \n\nWhy is this unsustainable? None of these startups are making any revenue which justifies spending so much on their hires. 40 LPA for a 0-2 years in-experienced SDE for a company whose total revenue is not even 1 CR lmao - It's a clear bubble waiting to burst\n\nJust take any of India's highest paying seed/A/B/C startups, their financials, the recent funding crunch and you will figure out why this is not going to work out\n\nAnd we are already seeing early signals of it - the funding winter directly means much less companies having money to splurge and parallely, we are having a higher than ever supply of engineers coming in thanks to layoffs, more admissions, alternate programs etc..\n\nThe correction will take time but it's bound to happen- and it will be a solid correction. The best ones will still sail through it imo but the average figures will drop considerably.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Agencies like DRDO, NIC, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) worked on Maya OS for 6 months\n\nThe Navy had already cleared it and the Army & Air Force are currently evaluating it.",

        "Id": "1bh386d",
        "Body": "TW: domestic abuse and narcissistic parents.\n\nI am a 27 year old graduate from BITS Pilani in \nComputer science. I was working as a product manager before, in a unicorn company. I had always had a dysfunctional family but things got really dark once I graduated and was working from home and living with them during COVID. I was subjected to persistent verbal, emotional and physical abuse at the hands of my parents and brother(yes, because I am a girl). It was hard to recognise at first because they will misbehave but eventually manipulate me into believing that it was my fault and I provoked them. \n\nThey would force me to cook for the family while I was working. And they would criticise me further, if I said this is too much along with my workload, commenting, \"what have I even done?\" They would make me feel generally worthless and as if I am a good-for-nothing burden on them. A time, my mother battered me so hard, I had blue bruises the size of my palm on my thighs, and tears on the skin of my hands, from the impact of the object. To date, she justifies it as an act of discipline and the rest of the family, if not supports, dismisses it.\n\n\nThroughout, I financially supported my brother, even took him out on outings, thinking maybe, he is not hostile like my parents, but was demeaned, degraded and verbally abused by him as well.\n\nLast year, battered and shattered,  I finally took the last call, filed a police complaint against them and left the house. Naturally, all of it has left me with a lot of emotional scars. The pain of having to cut off your family is one. The pain of having had to do it because they mistreated and nearly killed you is a whole another ball game.\n\nIn the overwhelming pressure of this, I left my job since the work culture there was also kinda stressful and under appreciative(regular Indian startup) and my plate of the daily pressures I could take was already full owing to the family abuse and discord.\n\nThe difficult part is, since then (a year), I have been giving product interviews, but it has not been working out. Since the market is already dried out and also because of my own mental state maybe, I have not been able to bag any role. This is weird because the first product role I bagged happened at the first interview I gave ever. Maybe, I have lost my touch, because of the chronic stress, or maybe it is plain bad luck. I don't know. Haven't been able to RCA this out.\n\nNow, I have decided to switch to an SDE role. I am decent at coding and the roles are also way more in number.\n\nIf any of you are aware of any SDE openings in companies, which are less biased against people with alternate career paths and a career gap, please let me know. I am ardent on getting my career back on track. It is the only thing that I have now. Also, some mental support would help. Life really whipped me the past 3 years.\n\n",

Who will get the coveted \u201cjob\u201d?\n\n\nAre diversity hires the competition? They get by with a for loop test and a HR round. The people selected for diversity hires are woman here. I\u2019ve been working 5+ years and men outnumber woman 10-1 in engineering. All those who get selected eventually transition out to a parallel role or the select few stay on as developers who have the knowledge.\n\n\nAre the people from Tier 1 colleges the competition? They did work hard to get there so yes they deserve the advantage. But it can only take you so far. It can open doors but not help climb the ladder upwards. \n\n\nYour main competition are people who are competent and good engineers. You can try and hack it by just leetcoding and job switching. Or you just get good. Quality software engineers are a scarcity. \n\nSo what does Quality mean here?\n* Someone who can traverse a new code base and not be overwhelmed \n* someone who knows how to communicate to unblock themselves without a babysitter to tell them what to do\n* someone who proactively tries to find possible improvements in a system \n* someone who can write clean code so that time wasted on refactoring is skipped \n\nFor an entry level engineer it can seem a lot. So most essential you can focus on how to communicate when you solve any problem out loud. Talk out loud about test cases and edge cases. Talk out loud and clarify requirements and not make assumptions. Taking ownership of the work you do. \n\n\nLeetcode is part of the game. System design is something everyone overlooks to learn and get better at. This job is about continuous improvement.

Those gave me a very strong gut feeling about this guy.\n\nFreshers, take what he says with a giant grain of salt and think for yourself.\n\nCrypto bro landed a remote job with some probably pump and dump crypto project or some NFT shit. Now he's using the \"4 cr\" tag to farm attention from freshers and JEE guys who don't know any better. His cohort is just selling shovels in a gold rush.   \nAlso he is very misleading, example: in one video this guy says that college doesn't matter with placement these days. And on-campus placements are also suffering, and that he heard from somewhere that only two companies visited IITD for internships.  \nSo, I agree that the job market is rough right now, but how can a guy from an IIT claim that only two companies visit IITD for internships (He should know better, I can say this because I am also from one). I will sacrifice my left nut if only two companies visit IITD for internships. This is clearly to mislead freshers and JEE guys who aren't in the know yet, probably to sell them his cohort. I don't think anyone 3rd year + or anyone with industry experience would find this guy credible.\n\n  \nVideo link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dl3w\\_VMTZU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dl3w_VMTZU) \n\ntimestamp- 1:48\n\nI am really interested to hear your take on this.

This will increase competition within businesses and will force them to treat their employees like humans. This was kind of the reason why things were generally good for employees from 2021-22 because all the startups popping up increased competition for labour.\n\nOr if your employer lays a bunch of people off and starts giving the rest of you their workload, simply refuse! Don't work extra long or extra hard. Get the employees together collectively and make everyone, or at least the majority refuse to entertain these outlandish demands from your employers. What are they gonna do? Fire you all and lose their business? And if that's not going to work, just do everything very poorly and if you're asked about it, just cite that there is a lack of manpower needed to get quality results.\n\nBasically, why have we collectively decided to take the short end of the stick and make our lives miserable when we should instead force employers to face consequences of THEIR OWN poor strategic planning?

I started with the official video playlist of Flutter and then quickly moved to documentation of Dart as without my dart game at max, I couldn't shoot up my Flutter game!\n\nI completed Angela Yu's course and alongside I extensively read docs, watched YouTube videos on widgets. After that, I started creating simple apps through YouTube tutorials.\n\nI learned Object Oriented Programming for about a month to make sure my code looks sexy and it isn't an mixed vegetable curry.\n\nRecently I learned State Management properly. Bloc was giving me nightmares so I switched to provider and the ability to separate my Business Logic with the UI layer - was revolutionary. I could design and deliver thousands of features. For the first time in my life, I truly saw how scaling could be done in a piece of  software.\n\nThe result of all of it is the app I have created and launched on Play Store - Productivity Companion.\n\nProductivity Companion is the ultimate productivity tool for all your tasks, jobs, and chores. It helps you track the amount of time you put in your work and give you amazing insights on how you can do better(Feature releasing soon!)!\n\nThis is the first version with minimalistic approach of your Productivity Companion, as cluttering the apps with lots of stuff which our users don't need will not work. Based on the feedback I have received from the early testers, following features will soon be live in all your devices in the next version of Productivity Companion:\n\n1. Will allow customization of colors, font, task icon, and background images.\n2. Will allow you to take Notes and create to-do List within a task.\n3. Will give you the data of your productive schedule in tabular and visual form.\n\nProceeding forward with \"Customer is the King\" philosophy, I am working super hard to serve you with the features that optimizes every second of the day. Your feedback, opinion and critique is quite important for me to grow and sustain.\n\nI hope that you love your Productivity Companion and I would love to hear what you think about it!\n\n[Play Store Link ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.philosophia.producitivitycompanion)",

I recently became an SDE-2 at my company here.\n\nI have no idea what to expect job wise in the current India scene. I\u2019ll admit I probably should have started exploring and applying earlier but it is what it is.\n\nSince you guys seem very helpful, I\u2019d be grateful for any generic tips.\n\nWhat kind of companies should I apply to? (Currently only applied to FAANGs in Hyderabad).\n\nHow much CTC can I expect? (Hoping at least 30L \ud83d\ude05 but maybe that\u2019s too optimistic)\n\nLastly, I\u2019m actually interested in using this as an opportunity to transition to maybe a manager role. Do you guys think that is feasible at my current level of experience? If not now, then I plan to work as a dev for a while and do an MBA in India and become a manager then.

We went around to check out the office. It was no office. It was just a couple of rooms with a few desktops. And the HR had the audacity to ask us if we had gotten the money! May be they hoped they could at least repair their roof with our money.\n\nI caught the next bus out of Erode to Bangalore with the hopes of my 3lac per annum job blown in the wind like a dandelion.",

Initially was happy because the job situation was already bad in 2022 and I was having an offer in hand but then it went only downhill from here. Firstly They cancelled my internship. Finally joined the company in july 2023. Now here comes the real shit. After joining I was in bench for almost 6 months. After that I was put into a shitty on site project where there is no option for wfh and have to work 6 days a week. And the work is just making reports on Excel. I am a cse grad and not a single day passes by where I don't think I am wasting my time here. No skill development as such. After spending so much money and time getting a cse degree and then u have to do a job that even a 12th pass can do is really depressing. So called witch company employees working on my project are doing better work than me and having all the perks of wfh and 5 day week working. Sometimes I wish I should have joined one of that companies.Already thinking of switch and started to apply for companies but no luck till now. I don't know for how long will I be stuck here. I fear with no skill development I might have to do this kind of job forever. I still don't understand whats a big hype behind the BIG 4s. \nAny tips on how to switch jobs will be helpful.",

I was looking for dev roles on the side while working at samsung and finally landed one. I was excited to be working as a dev again and gave in my notice period, but during that time I fell very ill and was unable to move as much and after my tenure at Samsung ended I was bed ridden for 12 days.\n\nI was supposed to start on the 18th of September at the new place and was feeling better but not 100%, I attend my first day at the office where we spent mind you no less than 6 hours completing HR formalities (not the point just something that annoyed me) anyway I felt like I was relapsing, I was barely able to ride back home that day, the next day i.e 19th of September we were off work and I hoped I would feel better enough to go the next day but unfortunately I did not further more my movement is also hindered as I feel too weak to even carry my own weight right now. I decided to talk to the HR since I did not have my line manager's number I was told to send in an email\n\nAround 10am I sent in an email explaining my condition and requesting delay the on-boarding process to next week. I did not receive a reply to my email but was called by the head HR at around 4pm, I explained my situation and request again and was met with \"ok but everyone else who joined the same day has started working and what if your illness comes back we can't keep delaying things just because you are sick\" to which I replied \"I wouldn't have asked for this if I wasn't really that sick, I am unable to move on my own\" and basically after that I was told that I am making excuses and they need an answer by the end of day whether I want to stay in the company or not. \n\nI sent another email stating that I have all intentions to stay in the company but and I'm only making this request as I am actually sick. I even said that if an extension wasn't possible I would be ok if my leaves are deducted. The next day on Thursday 21st of September I hear nothing back, and viola on 22nd September Friday I am sent an email stating that my contract is being terminated as I was required to be present in the office but wasn't. \n\nLine manager did not contact, upon confronting HR I was told \"you looked fine on Monday\" and literally had the call hung up on my when I spoke anything after that. So yea that's it my story of how I got fired because I am sick and must restart my job search.\n\nEDIT: Company\u2019s name is Gojoko Technologies which is a subsidiary of Amplifi Capital",

        "Body": "Our company is trying to hire a Devops engineer for some months and I am taking first round of interviews. Let me state the expectations first\n\nTotal domain => [https://roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops)\n\n1. 0-2 years | git, CICD tool(any) + process , python, linux, networking. Linux, networking in college level only\n2. 2-4 years | above plus any tools they have worked upon (containers/terraform/ansible/), simple solutioning on load balancing, cloud , secrets management\n3. 4-8 years | above plus complete and advance solutioning , monitoring, app performance\n4. 8+ | solutioning and architecting \n\nKnowing that it is not possible to know everything , I have been asking questions from their CV only with the expectation that we can train them with our requirements. here is what I found\n\n1. Most people have mentioned working in CICD but doesn't know actually is CICD and why do we require.\n2. Jenkins is the most popular tool found in these CV's\n3. AWS is the most common but people have hardly explored beyond EC2, S3. \n4. All of them has faked atleast something in their CV. While around 10% is acceptable, but more than 50% , totally not cool.\n5. 80% of the candidates don't know a single programming language (even python).\n6. Candidates claimed to have worked with load balancing but doesn't know the difference between application and network load balancers. Couldn't even ask about load balancing mechanism. \n7. Few candidates claimed to have worked with AWS Route 53 but doesn't know how DNS policies work (A record, CNAME, MX) \n8. People don't know what a subnet is but are expected to believe they wrote networking policies\n9. Most of them doesn't know how to work with git. \n10. Only around 1 or 2 candidates knew about best practices of technologies\n11. All of them mentions Kubernetes but fails to answer how to launch a pod or how to give access to someone or difference between deployments and stateful set.\n12. Most candidates are coming from XZY service based companies and know only about CICD pipelines (even experienced candidates)\n13. Could pass only 10-20% to second round. All basic questions were asked\n\nWith the advent of ChatGPT and bard, we are looking at a crisis. These service based companies would be losing devops clients requiring them to pivot. Only few would survive.\n\n**Conclusion:** Fake it till you make it ! But overdo it and you lose the chance.\n\nTips to aspiring Devops engineers: Have a look at [https://roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops) and learn the basics\n\nPS: Don't ask for referral since I will need to take first round , so conflict of Interest\n\nEdit : \nSince people are asking about position\n1. Multiple positions (beginner to experienced) for multiple projects\n2. Pay differs according to experience\n3. Both product and service based companies.\n\nThe issue I am trying to bring attention to is that \n1. the conversion ratio is low\n2. most people are faking the CV to a HUGE extent\n3. Very less knowledge on basics taught in degrees",

There are a lot more entry-level applications than open positions, often a 100x+ factor in mid size companies.\n\nIf you get 1000 applications for 10 positions, it's not practical for the recruiter to go through all of them. So they filter. Either manually, or via ATS, the first filter they apply is does this person have a degree. If 30% of them don't, that directly eliminates 30% of the effort needed.\n\nNow, that might mean that they loose out on some 10x dev, but that's a tradeoff they're willing to make since they have a lot of applicants to choose from.",

As someone who has successfully made the transition into the tech industry, I know firsthand the challenges and struggles that designers and product managers face.\n\nToday, I'm sharing **8 proven strategies from my personal story**, a self-taught designer who landed a Design Lead role at Gotrade (YC S19).\n\nLet's dive into the 8 key strategies (\ud83d\udcf7 with interesting historical references from famous figures).Step 1. Understand The Company\n\nBefore you can woo a company, you need to know them inside and out, like a biography writer researching their subject.\n\n>**\ud83d\udcf7** **True story:** Remember when Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 and steered the sinking ship back into clear waters? He had an intimate understanding of Apple's mission and culture. You need the same level of understanding about the company you want to join.\n\nActionable steps:\n\n* *Research the company's mission, recent news, market trends, and the backgrounds of its leaders and interviewers.*\n* *Use tools like Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and the company's own website to gather information.*\n* *Try to understand the company's pain points and how your role could address them.*\n\nStep 2. Leverage Warm Intros\n\nIn the world of networking, warm introductions are the holy grail. They're like a secret handshake that gets you past the velvet rope and into the VIP section.\n\n>**\ud83d\udcf7** **True story:** In the early days of Airbnb, the founders used warm intros to connect with potential investors and mentors, leading them to their first funding round. It can work the same way for you in landing a design role.\n\nActionable steps:\n\n* *Scan your networks for any connections to the company.*\n* *Engage with their content and ask for advice or mentorship.*\n* *Use platforms like LinkedIn or ADPList to find potential connections.*\n\nStep 3. Craft for \"Tell Me About Yourself\"\n\nThis is your moment to shine, to craft a narrative about your past, present, and future that will captivate your interviewers.\n\n>**\ud83d\udcf7** **True story:** When Elon Musk explains his journey, he doesn't just list off his accomplishments. He talks about his passion for technology, his visions for the future, and the key decisions that led him to where he is now. This is the same kind of storytelling you need to master.\n\nActionable steps:\n\n* *Develop a concise but compelling story about your journey into design.*\n* *Highlight key decisions and insights that have shaped your career.*\n* *Practice this story until you can tell it naturally and confidently.*\n\nStep 4. Targeted Companies\n\nJust like how different species of birds have unique calls, every company has its unique needs and preferences. Meta and Google, for example, lean towards data-led design, while Apple is all about visuals.\n\n>**\ud83d\udcf7** **True story:** In 2009, when Square was just a small start-up, they weren't looking for a jack-of-all-trades. They needed a designer who could build a simple, user-friendly payment app. Knowing what a company is specifically looking for can help you tailor your approach and stand out from the crowd.\n\nActionable steps:\n\n* *Understand the needs of the companies you're interested in.*\n* *Learn about their past hires and what they valued in them.*\n* *Tailor your portfolio to match the company's style and needs.*\n\nStep 5. Targeted Network\n\nBefore you send off that job application, try to connect with a few employees at the company.\n\n>**\ud83d\udcf7** **True story:** When Sheryl Sandberg was considering joining Facebook as COO, she met with numerous employees to understand the culture and challenges of the company. This not only gave her insights into Facebook but also helped her establish connections within the company.\n\nActionable steps:\n\n* *Reach out to 1-2 employees at the company.*\n* *Send a personalized note asking if they'd be willing to share their insights about the company.*\n* *Use the information you gain to improve your application and interview preparations.*\n\nStep 6. Challenge Them (Humbly)\n\nWhen you're asked, \"Do you have any questions for me?\" during an interview, it's your chance to show your preparation and curiosity. You want to challenge their thinking, not just ask about vacation days or company culture.\n\n>**\ud83d\udcf7** **True story:** When Reed Hastings was considering investing in Netflix, he didn't just ask about their business model. He asked challenging questions that made the Netflix team think deeply about their strategy and future. You want to do the same in your job interviews.\n\n**Actionable steps:**\n\n* *Prepare thoughtful questions about the company's projects, strategies, and challenges.*\n* *Show that you've done your homework by asking specific, informed questions.*\n* *Be respectful and humble when asking these questions.*\n\nStep 7. Contribute Into Future\n\nInterviews are not just about what you've done in the past, but what you can do in the future. People want to hire folks they're confident can bring in results (fast).\n\n>**\ud83d\udcf7** **True story:** When Sundar Pichai was interviewed at Google, he didn't just talk about his past experience. He also shared his vision for Google's future and how he could contribute to it. This approach can work for you too.\n\nActionable steps:\n\n* *Think about what skills and ideas you can bring to the company.*\n* *Show them how you can contribute to their future success.*\n* *Be specific about what you'd improve and how you'd do it.*\n\nStep 8. Tell Story With Results\n\nForget about going on and on about your design process. What matters is the impact you've made with your work. It's like showing the delicious cake you baked, not explaining every step of the baking process.\n\n>**\ud83d\udcf7** **True story:** When Jony Ive presented the design of the iPhone, he didn't just talk about the design process. He demonstrated the end result and its impact on the user experience. This is the kind of storytelling you need to employ in your interviews.\n\nActionable steps:\n\n* *Showcase the results of your design work in your portfolio and during your interviews.*\n* *Highlight the impact your designs have had.*\n* *Limit the explanation of your process to about 10% of your presentation.*\n\nFinal key takeaways\n\n1. **Research**: Thoroughly understand the company, role, and key personnel before the interview.\n2. **Networking**: Leverage your connections for introductions and insights into the company.\n3. **Prepare Your Story**: Craft a compelling response to \"Tell Me About Yourself\", focusing on key decisions and insights.\n4. **Tailor Your Approach**: Understand the unique needs and goals of the company and tailor your portfolio and application to match.\n5. **Connect with Employees**: Prior to applying, engage with 1-2 employees from the company to gain insights.\n6. **Show Critical Thinking**: Use the opportunity to ask the interviewer questions to challenge their thinking and demonstrate your preparation.\n7. **Internships**: Shine in an internship by exceeding expectations and making yourself indispensable.\n8. **Apply for the Right Jobs**: Exercise empathy, make your CV/resume a story, and tailor your approach to the company you really want to work for.\n9. **Nail the Interview**: Articulate your creative process, describe design challenges you've experienced, and explain the rationale behind your creative decisions.\u200b",

I clarified him that I've more experience in mysql and have had little experience in mongodb, and moreover syntax shouldn't be an issue.

        "Title": "Got 2 FTE offers being from non tech",
        "Id": "18crwpj",
        "Body": "So, I graduated in May 23 from a tier 2 college with a degree in mechanical engineering. And I had an internship experience of 6 months working for a startup as a full stack developer which I secured through off campus. But due to the current state of the market, it couldn't get converted to a FTE role. \n\nAfter being unemployed for about 4 months and around 1000 applications for jobs, finally I got lucky getting 2 offers simultaneously. But this wasn't easy, you might think how a non tech guy is getting offers in this recession. \n\nI was always a hardworking person, scored great grades in school and college. I started learning DSA in my 5th sem when I came across a course. In the year 2022, i was very consistent, solved around 800 problems on various platforms. And side by side learnt web dev and built some good projects. I really enjoyed it. And beside this I was still maintaining a good SGPA. \n\nSo, I got the internship off campus in jan 2023 with a stipend of 35k. I was told by the CEO that I was the only one selected from the 1500 applications they received(not bragging here, just to make you understand that I'm pretty good at what I do).\n\nOkay, so how I got the current FTE offers. I did a lot of take home assignments (around 15) for various companies. But getting to the interviews was a difficult task. After around 1000 applications, and numerous \"unfortunately\" emails, I applied for another small startup for a full stack dev role. Got an assignment, did well in that, gave few interviews and got the offer last week. This offer was WFO role, six days a week. \n\nBefore the previous offer was given, a recruiter from a well known startup approached me. This time as well, I got an assignment, completed it, did well, then moved to the interviews. The interviews were pretty rigorous. I got the offer from this company as well. They gave me a slight better compensation than the other offer, plus it's a hybrid role. This is obviously a benefit.\n\nSince this is a well known startup, I was expecting a bit more of the compensation, but since I'm a fresher, I feel it's fine. Getting my foot into a product based company is good enough. \n \nSome suggestions I would to like to give people who are working hard everyday looking for jobs - few things I noticed were that, getting interviews in MNCs are pretty difficult if you are trying off campus. So apply mostly to startups. Combining all the interviews I gave in the past 4 months, I was asked a total of only 2 problems on DSA. So I would suggest that improve upon your tech stack rather than giving more time to leetcode. And keep applying, you all will get lucky in the coming days. \n\nGetting depressed is pretty common in these times, I was one of you few days back, but make sure that if you have an interview scheduled, try to be happy and in a good mood in front of the interviewer. It helps a lot.\n\nI won't reveal the CTC, but the monthly pay would be more than 60k. Being a fresher from non tech, I feel this is good enough. I will surely work harder and switch to FAANG in 1-2 years, since I'm pretty good at DSA and have learnt LLD and other CS fundamentals.\n\nKeep your heads high, you guys will do something great in your life.

        "Body": "I know about 3 people who did this \u2014 let me tell you what happened with all 3. All these happened in Accenture.\n\n1st person tried to pose as a developer and get a job. Cleared the interview and joined the organisation too. Was in the job for 24 months, even got promoted once untill the manager finally called the bluff ( there were a lot of complaint about the quality bof work and too many issues reported due to the code, was put to work with a tech Arch who finally found the reason) and smoked the person out. Was fired and is now blacklisted in Accenture.\n\n2nd person posed as a support executive and told that they have hands on technology knowledge and experience and want to switch to Development. Was smoked our in the 3rd month itself as having no knowledge. Was moved to a Support team internally and failed to performed the same role as described in their resume. Was fired and is now blacklisted in Accenture.\n\n3rd person also claimed to be a Developer. Cleared the interview and joined the organisation too. Spoke with their reporting manager, came clear about the bluff and told effort will not be problem, but guidance will be needed. Was moved to a support role and worked there since. It's been 4 years since this person joined and then got 2 promotion just due to amout of effort put in. Presently is leading a team of 15 and is considered a SME.

        "Id": "1b401so",
        "Body": "I can see that lots of people are posting here that, they're not getting any calls even after applying for hundreds of posts.\n\nI am no expert in this matter but as a guy who got 10+ calls from naukri within first week, and also looked at how HR shortlists the resumes in my previous company, here are my 2 cents.\n\n1. Don't use tables. It can confuse ATS.\n\n2. If you're using word document, use Microsoft Word or at least check whether your dicument rendering properly in Microsoft word.\n\n3. Don't use custom fonts. It's OK for pdf resumes but it's better to avoid.\n\n4. World runs on Excel sheets, so does HRs. HR managers copy the details from your resume in to the excel sheet. So make sure copying from your PDF resume is not disabled.\n\n5. Resume shouldn't be morethan 2 pages long. No one has time to read about your shitty auto-biography.\n\n6. Your education, total experience and skills should be on top of first page.\n\n7. Use total experience in bold. No one has time to add your individual experiences.\n\n8. Create a section with heading skills and list all ghe skills you've. Don't include them in sentences. HRs just look over your resume and copies them into excel sheet. So, make it easy for them to copy.\n\n9. It's better to have above details in bold text.\n\n10. Freshers please do not use the same projects as your friend. Especially don't add the projects like tic-tac-toe, todos, food delivery app ...etc. It's better to have resume without any projects than above ones. Trust me, 3 out of 5 resumes have these projects.\n\n11. Another issue with freshers(especially tier-3 colleges) is, entire college uses same resume template with just name change. Invest some time and create your own resume instead of using existing template which was already used by 1000s. \n\n12. If you know anyone with the employer account on naukri, you can use it to see on which position your profile is listed for your skills and city. Optimise Your profile till it reaches top 30.\n\nI know thse are very basic and boring tips, but these helped me very much.\n\nPS. Remember this, most HRs don't know have technical knowledge. They just search the Naukri using details given by Managers.\n\nP.S. If you're not getting any calls after one week, create a completely new resume instead of modifying existing one",

        "Id": "18aeeyp",
        "Body": "I was studying B.Tech and was in my final semester. As per the college criteria, in the last semester, everyone had to do some project or internship. So, it was my last day to join any internship, or else I would have failed, I guess. By the way, it was not just me; my whole group was with me, looking for an internship in the last days. A friend gave a reference for us in a startup and told us that we all could join. It was pre-COVID days, so there were almost no employees, just us and the founder in the company.\n\nThe founder used to assign tasks to us, and everyone tried to do them. However, only my friend and I from the whole group were working properly, and we used to solve any task he assigned us. Slowly, the task difficulty grew, and we (my friend and I) built a whole SaaS application from scratch within 6-7 months of joining the company. The other friend who helped build it was not interested, so he left, and the only people left in the company were the founder and myself. By the way, it was an unpaid internship for the first 4 months, and later he started paying both of us Rs. 25k/month. The founder used to look older than us, like in his 30s, but later on, I found out we were both the same age, 23 years old, lol.\n\nNow, both the founder and I were working our tails off day and night, anytime, anywhere. Once, I was traveling somewhere on my bike, and a major issue occurred on the server. I stopped the bike on the side and started fixing the issue on the road itself, xD.\n\nHe was looking into sales, marketing, etc., and I was handling client onboarding, handling client issues, understanding their pain points, suggesting solutions, feature development, bug fixing, scaling, deployment, etc.\n\nFast forward, now the company is generating decent revenue, at least 5 lakh per month, and there were only two of us in the company. He gave me a hike and raised my salary from 25k/month to 50k/month. He started approaching investors during the COVID time, but he was persistent and failing to secure investment. It's been 5 months, and still no sign of an investor. I was also expecting to get some shares from the founder, as both of us built it up from scratch and worked hard. I raised my point that I wanted some shares in the company because we built it from scratch. He told me I would get shares once we raised funding, as part of ESOP, which I didn't like. During the period he was raising the round, I left the company out of self-respect.   \n\n\nHere, I want your thoughts to know if I was wrong in any way, or if I did the right thing. I think I did the right thing.",

In the first call, the HR informed me that it is not a Lead position, it is just an Android Developer position. They also said their budget is 2 LPA lesser than my ask and I was fine with it.\n\nHR informed me I would get a task by EOD and I received it over an email. The task looked like a new implementation they were working on and they could not find a solution with their way. Basically, it looked like a piece of code written by my junior and reassigned to me since my junior could not find a solution.\n\nNevertheless, I completed the task and submitted it in two days (received the task on Tuesday EOD and submitted it by Thursday night). After this, there was no response till Monday and I sent an email asking about the expected TAT. HR said they will reply by the next day. No response after that till the next Monday and by then I had received 2 other offers and 2 interviews scheduled. So I sent an email asking whether I should wait or I should proceed to other offers/interviews. By EOD I received an automated response that I have been rejected.\n\nThinking over it, its clear now that they could not afford me. Frankly, I do not mind getting rejected from companies like this because they clearly lack professionalism and shows all kinds of red flags that a good developer would not want from their workplace. I just wanted to share my experience here so that good developers will not consider interviewing for this company after reading this.",

Basically je want everything to be done like a corporate setup but wamts us to do everything in addition to our job. Like picking up office keys from his home and dropping them off at home. And we have to do testing too, which is not that big of a deal I think. But now he wants us to do data entry on the platform too. And when one of us talks to him about basic things like working from home, he gets really upset. And even if he agrees to it, then the other guy has  to separately ask him about it. On top of that, he needs daily mail reporting about our work failing which we're marked as absent. And additionally, we also have to update a worksheet about the status and time taken on tasks. This I can understand but then what's the point of mail?\n\nI know people say that you should just bear with these things in the start of your career but I'm really rethinking my choice in joining here.

        "Body": "For a year or so I am trying to get a good internship but my DS ALGO is weak so a good company is out of the question. Now coming to the development part I would say I am pretty good at development as a student. Whenever I go to platforms like Internshala, Instashyre, cuvette, cutshort etc etc and whatnot best job searching platforms, I see many internships and after applying to those, I have the same results. They want me to do a big and complicated assignment. Time to elaborate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are asking to build a full-stack MERN CMS, admin dashboard, quiz app, e-commerce app and whatnot. Some are even asking to build full-stack social media apps. And all of these complex web apps need to be built within 2 to 3 days as the deadline. Like kuch bhi. How in the world can someone build such complex web apps within 3 days and also with best optimizations and code quality. It happened to me multiple times. I made e-commerce and full-stack apps for them within 3 days by working my a\\*\\* off the night but after I submit the assignments,  they say I didn't made it to the second round or I am not good enough or they don't even respond.(Being unprofessional,\"m\\*ad\\*rc\\*\\*d, then why make me do the assignments even in the first place, if I am not good enough).  They want best of the world code quality, enterprise production level quality from a student who want to gain experience and learn, wow. \n\nNow some will say maybe I am not good enough, but what do you expect from a student, code repo as good as 10yrs exp person. I know MERN stack and I build projects using that. I know what is out there, and I always grind and my code is as good as most of the students and I am hella confident in that. \n\nAlso now some will say if you don't want to develop software then why come in the field?\n\nMy problem is not that mate. My point is why I will work for free to build a complex web application for a company that I don't had interview with yet and no guarantees of anything. Like I said some don't even respond after submission. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nComing to the conclusion, I personally thing these are scams to get their work done for free. I got assignments from assignment IBM and they wanted me to solve 2 ds algo questions. I also did interviews with good startups and they straight jumped to the phone call with interview scheduled later. None of the good companies wanted me to build a complex web app. From what I experienced these companies are scamming innocent students and grads. Like who knows, maybe they want a code template and want it for free, or some may want the exact app and get it done by a innocent student and then change it a little and then sell it to their customers.\n\nAnd honorary brats(companies) that do these type of scams that I know are:-\n\n1. BlackCoffer\n2. Super Assistant\n3. Stamurai\n4. TheDigitalShift\n5. QuadBtech\n6. Cipher Schools\n7. Cipher School\n8. Inkoop\n9. Emitrr   \nand many more that I forgot the names even  \n\n\nI thing our INDIAN government should take some steps to clean up this mess. Anybody's coming and making people work for free giving them hope.   \n\n\nSorry for the long write but full elaboration was indeed needed. And sorry for slangs but when you make complex apps for absolutely free without sleep multiple times, you'll also be angry. It does take a toll on my mental and physical health.  \n",

I attended the interview, and during the initial phase, the HR representative handed me an aptitude question paper and asked me to complete it within 15 minutes. After finishing the paper, I was told to wait for my technical round, which ended up being a one-hour wait.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually, the HR called me into a cabin and handed me a phone with the Zoom app open, explaining that the CEO would conduct my technical interview remotely. I held the HR's phone and participated in the interview. Initially, the CEO's front camera was on, showing his home environment. However, he soon turned off his camera, and mine was activated. He proceeded to ask me questions related to front-end development, and I answered all of them to the best of my ability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTowards the end of the interview, the CEO inquired if I had one year of experience. I honestly admitted that I had six months of internship experience. In a rather abrupt and impolite manner, he informed me that they were looking for a candidate with one year of experience. I tried to reassure him that I was capable of performing the role effectively and even offered to work as an intern without payment. Unfortunately, he rudely disconnected the call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI shared my experience with the HR department, but they dismissed my concerns, claiming it was my problem. I am disappointed because I had to travel 30 kilometers for this job interview, which cost me money. Furthermore, it was frustrating to discover that the CEO was comfortably working from home, yet I was required to come to their office for the interview. What adds to the disappointment is that, despite answering all their questions correctly, I was rejected solely due to a lack of experience, which seems hypocritical given the circumstances.",

Like, a Todo app using MERN, a real time chat using socket io or a movie recommendation system.. You know the projects which you see on the first page of youtube search. \n\nAnd on top of it, everybody had only surface level knowledge.. The one you get by following the tutorials blindly and doing it just for the sake of it. \n\nThough it shows a self-starter attitude but it is not enough.. As you took one step forward but everyone else also took that one step.. So essentially you are still a part of the crowd!\n\nSo what to do? \nBe curious and do what no one is doing. \nDo a thing using multiple stack. \nExpand the scope of the problem \nDo one project and do it thoroughly.. Know its in and outs. \n\nSay for example.. Everyone is creating a todo app using MERN\nWhat you can do\n\nCreate it using postgres as well.. Make db schema.. Read about transactions, ACID. \nUse java as BE language (since it is static and compiled)\nSo create the same project in multiple variants \nReact + node + mongo (usual suspect) \nReact + node + postgres\nReact + java + postgres\n\nThis way you will know pros and cons of these competing tech stacks and have a much better understanding of the choices you made. \n\nTo expand the scope of the problem.. You can add say... Undo, redo, attaching an alarm with each todo and sending notification at that time (think cron job). Thess things will create uniqueness in a rather generic project. \n\nTo take it a notch further,explore what is in-memory db, its pros ans cons... use Redis...say to store alarms.\n\nTo take it even further, learn about docker and create a docker compos file which will spin up all of your components(fe, be, db, redis) \n\nAnd for \"salary kitni loge\" moment (3 idiots)... Have a look at Kubernetes and use minikube. \n\n\nI think all of this can be done diligently in a couple of months and it will make you truly stand out in the crowded job market. \n\nNote: this is another random opinion in the sea of opinions on the internet.. So assess yourself before following it. But if you do and it doesn't work out (I'd be very surprised though) then dont hold it against me... And yeah... Send me your resume in that case.",

I know my strengths and weaknesses, and the plan that works for a computer science graduate will not work for me.\n\nThe person on the phone kept insisting that it would take me 4+ years to reach my goals if I went the self-learning route, and that some people prefer **\"slow growth\"**. Throughout the conversation, I felt like they were saying that I would not be able to get a job at a good company with a high-paying salary without their tailored training. They said that the course costs around 3 LPA, which I can easily make back when I secure a high-paying job at my next company. They have great teachers on their team, and I hope they will do great with this platform. However, I feel that if Scaler is using aggressive marketing strategies, they may end up like Byju's.  \n\n\nEdit: There is a typo in the company name. It's **Scaler**, not **Scalar**.",

Google could exploit this by favouring Chrome as the attester, subtly promoting Chrome's dominance over other browsers like Firefox. A vendor lock-in in disguise!  \n\"Attesters\" decide whether your device and/or browser is \"trustworthy\" enough - as defined by the website you are trying to visit.   \nIt is specifically designed to destroy the open web by denying you the right to use whatever browser you want to use, on whatever operating system.\n\nAnother concern lies with limiting ad blockers. With Manifest v3, Google intends to restrict ad-blocking capabilities in Chrome extensions. Combined with WEI API, Google could potentially gain more control over the browsing experience, monopoly and ad revenue.  \nThis API provides almost no benefit, but could end up hurting small browser forks, modded Android/iOS phones, custom Linux distros, user privacy by giving attesters more data points and limiting privacy tools, user experience by breaking ad-blocking.   \n\n\nYouTubers like Louis Rossmann have also [heavily criticized this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i0Ho-x7s_U) and it is also receiving huge backlash on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues). We need to make sure that they fail, and the only way to do this is to spread awareness about it and talk about it more.  \n\n\n*I've posted a thread on Twitter about it, feel free to retweet it and share it with everyone and let them know about this:* [*https://twitter.com/0xDPJ/status/1683041313531523072*](https://twitter.com/0xDPJ/status/1683041313531523072)",

I am also a [typeface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface) designer who designed and engineered some of the most used Malayalam typefaces.\n\nA short bio and some of my projects can be found on [my personal website](https://thottingal.in/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/santhoshtr) profile.\n\nI joined [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/) in 2011 and since then working on technologies that help millions of users to have their wikipedia in their language. I worked on fonts, input tools, localization, translation etc for [Wikipedia in 300+ languages](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias). Currently I focus on machine translation infrastructure at Wikimedia where we built a massive [self hosted machine translation system supporting 250+ languages](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2023/06/13/mint-supporting-underserved-languages-with-open-machine-translation/).\n\nI am also part of [Swathanthra Malayalam Computing](https://smc.org.in), a free software community of volunteers to build free and opensource language technologies for Malayalam from its early days.

When I requested to refer to the documentation, they declined. Eventually, they rejected me, stating that they were seeking someone with experience. This led me to wonder how someone could expect an intern to be experienced. In my observation, many recruiters in India lack seriousness and seem to aim to exploit interns.",

Also ranting that all I was getting were rejection from off campus SDE interviews. \nIt was just so frustrating, and I was so pissed off to a point I broke down into tears one night.  Everyday I woke up anxious and every night I went to bed anxious. The fact that I had no job just drowned my mood. I saw no hope left. \n\nSo today I just wanted to share something positive in this awesome sub from my side after so much negativity. I remember a comment from a user on my previous post saying \"maybe there's a better opportunity waiting for you\" And they were absolutely right. There were other uplifting comments as well (This sub is honestly the warmest subreddit I have come across, hands down). The company which I am about to join has offered me almost twice the compensation which previous companies offered. Trust me, something good is always waiting for you if things are not working out right now. And every step you take forward is worth celebrating. For those who are still struggling to find a job in these tough times and interviewing, hang in there and things will work out, believe me. \n\nA little about me - I am a entry level software engineer only having 7 months of experience and 2022 passout. I got layed off in June from a startup whose manager was a bitch. I am almost a year behind my colleagues who have 1.5+ yoe and yes while I do have some regret over this career gap I am not thinking too much about it. \n\nTLDR; I got a job offer from a better company than the ones who rejected me before and I just wanted to share this with you all.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the wishes, appreciated. \ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ud83d\ude0a",

        "Body": "**TL;DR:** Tried recruiting software developers from SM (including Reddit) for my organization, but many initially 'enthusiastic' candidates turned unresponsive or made unreasonable demands when approached by HR.\n\nWanted to share my recent experience with trying to help my organization recruit software developers from multiple social media platforms. I am a Software Developer myself, and since we were not getting quality CVs from our recuitment partners, I first scanned all of my contacts and also thought of checking social media for the same. Initially, I was excited to tap into this promising channel, but unfortunately, the whole experience turned out to be quite disheartening.\n\nWhen I first mentioned about job openings at my company, I received an overwhelming response from many enthusiastic candidates. I had called them to check and resolve any of their as well as my doubts before forwarding their CVs. Most seemed genuinely interested and eager to work with us. It seemed very promising till this point.\n\nHowever, things took a downturn. Some of the candidates who initially appeared keen suddenly turned cold and unresponsive. It was puzzling to see the shift in their attitude after expressing so much interest before. When our HR contacted, some of them even mentioned having other job offers on hand (which they did not mention to me before), and trying to get some compromise like WFH or higher compensation (again, WFO in the initial phase is required to get the candidate ramped up fast, and it was mentioned). As a result, from around 15 people that I had reffered, hardly 1-2 appeared for an interview, no one was selected.\n\nAnother issue that arose was with certain candidates not being ready to work in hybrid env, even though it was **clearly mentioned** in the job posting. We respect remote work preferences and are very flexible in accmmodating temporary needs as well as up to 2 WFH per week, but it was disappointing to see that the candidates who were intially okay with this, wanted full time WFH suddenly. This saga had a negative effect on my peace (albeit temporarily) as I got sandwitched between a ghosting candidate, and nagging HR. \n\nThe most frustrating part of the experience was when some candidates simply stopped responding altogether. We understand that not everyone may be interested in the opportunity after learning more about it, but we expect to receive a simple rejection or explanation to the least.\n\nAs a result of this disappointing experience, I have to admit that I'm reluctant to make any further referrals from social media. I wanted to share this with all of you to take your opinion on what should be the correct approach. To all the job seekers (especially the freshers), please note that it is crucial to communicate openly and professionally.\n\nTo my fellow Redditors who have had positive experiences with recruitment (from SM), I would love to hear your insights and tips on how to make this process smoother.\n\nAlso if anyone thinks that compensation was the issue, then let me assure that we offer much better compared to the CHWTIA orgs.",

They ended the meeting with this sentence: \"Wow that is a very clever solution and is exactly what we are looking for, great work <NAME>. Please give us access to these resources, I will present this solution to the leadership. And <NAME>, I am afraid that we have to go separate paths from here, I hope you understand that you are only an <my\\_level> (this is my first job and I joined a few months ago) and so we cannot allow someone in-experienced like you to work on such a sensitive topic\"\n\nI was shocked and I was not able to speak, I honestly felt like crying.\n\nI did not want to work on the project because it would have a big impact and help me with a promotion, but I just wanted to work because it was a very interesting engineering problem and was the first thing that I created independently.\n\nLooking for advice from experienced folks on what to do in this situation.",

        "Title": "SDE1@Amazon: My mental health is deteriorating",
        "Id": "14qgn4g",
        "Body": "I joined as an intern in a company in Pune in 2019 when I got another intern offer as a QAE1 in Amazon. Even though my interests were in software development I was very happy that my dream had come true. Never in my life had I ever imagine that I will be able to crack and Amazon interview. I became a full time employee as QAE1 in 2020. After that I wanted to pursue my real interest which was software development. And that also happened very well as I got my role converted to SDE1 in 2021 Jan.\n\nFor a few months everything was very fine, I was delivering whatever was expected out of me. Then came this big project on which I had to work for extended hours due to last minute changes in the expectations from the PM team. I was working around 16 to 18 hours a day and all I took all my meals while my code changes were building.\nAfter this project got over I got burn out and I lost motivation to work for around 2 months. After the two months my manager told me that I was not meeting expectations of SDE1 since I did not have any commits in the last 2 months. I got put into something known as a coaching plan. In this I would take a project and my performance would be monitored.\n\nI did not question this coaching plan because I knew that I was not working at my 100%. I also had faith in my manager that if I work for 2 months he would take me out of that coaching plan and everything would be alright. Also I could not change my teams inside Amazon.\n\nI did SEO for 2 months and after 2 months I was told that there is no impact of what I had done which was surprising because it's not possible to see the impact of SEO in 2 months.\nI was told to take another project that has a significant impact on the team. In between this project my manager and my senior manager left the team. I got assigned another manager. I work very hard on that project and brought it to closure. I was in a lot of pressure because it was the time when the recession had started. I was thinking that I could lose my job.\n\nAfter I completed that project, my manager told me that I cannot inform you if you are in a coaching plan or not. Because this information is not to be told to the employee and should only be between the manager and the HR. He even said that if you are previous manager was still in our team I would have handed him over to the HR. I contacted HR myself and talk about how I was not feeling good even though I was working I was not informed that I am in a coaching plan or not. After my meeting with HR, they did not tell me anything and were not responding to my texts. Before I could escalate it any further my team got shutdown.\n\nWhen I went to the new team I thought everything would be new I would get a fresh start but the same coaching plan was continued. Even though I delivered everything that I was assigned I was not taken out of the coaching plan. It seems that everything that I am doing is falling short of the expectations that they are having. I been told that there are no technical gaps. Amazon has some leadership principles and my manager would just pick nitty gritty detail and map it to one of the leadership principles and tell me that I was falling short there. \n\nI have been in this coaching plan for 1 year now and my mental health is taken a toll. I can confidently save that there is no technical incompetency issue. I am fully confident about my technical skills. My pears have taken a promotion and I was not even given a raise last year.\n\nI know I am only 24 and its not the end of the world but it makes me think that if so many people are saying maybe there is something wrong with me and myself confidence is getting lost. This is also impacting my judgement about various technical things. And I have started to second guess my every decision.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what I can do?\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks a lot everyone for all the support. This really means a lot when it comes from fellow developers. \n\nAlso something to clarify, in Amazon there is something called as coaching plan if you don't perform well in coaching plan , they will bring a pivot where you can take a severance and leave or you can do a task which will be assigned to you in strict timelines. \n\nThis task is generally impossible to achieve in the timeline and is a death sentence. If you fail in that task, your severance is cut in half and you are let go.\n\nI'm currently not in PIP. They can't put me in PIP because I have regular commits in the internal code repository which is something that they can't dis-proove.",

But catch was he had to pay 75k.\n\nHe refused.  They insisted and said u can attend interviews but he had to pay somewhere in middle of interview. My friend did attend interview.  Inteeview Mails came from Bank's email id. 2 rounds went decent. My friend looked up interviewers and they had legit linkedin profiles. And when final hr round came, consultancy insisted on payment. My friend discussed this with us. Being a decade old, in this industry and our network of hr, no one understood why we need to pay and discouraged our friend. I told him casually , there are thousand better companies, u can join, why do u need this one.  My friend took a stand to let go of this opportunity. Consultancy played all sort of mind games from persuading to threatening and they stopped calling. \n\nAfter a month, through friend of friend he met HR at same bank and discussed this. HR was taken back and confirmed there was hiring freeze for long time and that too at program manager levels. My friend formally reported and it was found some employees and external consultants had colluded and targeted desperate persons to get 10k-75k amount for interview opportunity and then reject them at final round or make a unreasonable offers, like offering a remote north Indian location for a South Indian.\n\nNo matter how desperate u are , always reach out for info on your network or here.

The main issue now is all certification timings are clashing with each other. Every trainer wants to train at the same time.\n\nHere comes the worst part- No option for refund, no other class timings available. Even the recruiter has no clue what to do. And the customer service- plain pathetic.\n\nAlot of amount wasted. And most importantly, lesson learned. Never to go for live online classes.\n\nUdemy is the best. Course fees are not more than 400-500. And you can learn at your own pace, with certifications at the end.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this with online live courses as well? Would love to know individual experiences.",

I thought it might be a mistake from the HR side since I didn't receive any mail regarding the cancelled interview. I joined the meeting at the scheduled time and realised that no one is going to join :-)\n\nI felt bad regarding this, the least they could have done was send a mail to me regarding cancellation of my interview, had I not checked my calendar I wouldn't have even known. The next day I mailed them regarding this, asking if there was any rescheduling and now they inform me that they have reached their selected candidates quota hence they won't be moving forward.\n\nIt was my first time experiencing something like this but I guess it is what is it :-)\n\nJust wanted to share my experience here.\n\nEdit - Guys by quota I meant the limit.....the mail specified they reached their 'target requirement'.",

        "Body": "This Wednesday, I received a ticket to resolve, and I started working on it. I completed it by Thursday afternoon. However, on that Thursday, my manager assigned me a new ticket that was quite complex and had multiple aspects to check. During the Scrum call, while my manager was explaining it, I didn't pay full attention and just responded with an \"Ok.\"\n\nI distinctly remember my manager didn't specify that this new ticket had to be included in the Friday build. However, when he updated the group later, he added a deadline of noon for the same Friday. Unfortunately, I didn't notice this change and proceeded to work on the Wednesday ticket as planned.\n\nWhen I was going through the changes with the tester, they pointed out that this new ticket was critical and needed to be completed by the end of the day. I was taken aback, realizing it was already 5 pm, and I hadn't even started. I felt overwhelmed and stressed by the situation. Testers began questioning why it was taking so long for such a seemingly small task, and I explained that it wasn't clear in the ticket that it would be complex.\n\nI had to work through the night to try to resolve the issues, but it was still not complete due to numerous unexpected complications. I communicated the situation to my manager and requested that the task be moved to the next sprint, but it didn't get approved. In the end, I merged the incomplete work, not fully understanding which parts were functional, and hoped for the best.\n\nThe lesson you can learned from this experience is the importance of being attentive during Scrum meetings when tasks are assigned to your name. It's crucial to ensure you fully understand the expectations to avoid getting into situations like this one.",

There is no TLDR.\n\nTo the junior developers, if this helps: \n\nWithin a matter of time, you would be a good at your job.   \nAt some point in your career, of course, there would be this imposter syndrome. However, when you realize it happens to all, well then you know, you are fine and won't worry about it much.  \nI have seen the worst developers transform into exceptional ones, many of them settled and happy in their comfort zones, and some of them who were laid off doing so much better now and so on. \n\nBut what you need to learn and what no one teaches you, is to be a good interviewer. I have attended so many interviews in the past (both, abroad and here), failed in a lot many, given stupid answers too, but let me tell you, in 99.9% of the abroad ones, I was interviewed by a good soul (Left 0.1 just to be flexible)\n\nSadly, I can't say the same for our country. I have met so many bad interviewers. So many of them. \n\nMany of them don't switch on the cameras, well that is fine, it's a personal choice, let's not go there.   \n\n\nBut some have mocked me, insulted, angered me and cancelled the interview at the last minute. That's bad. \n\nPeople outside India, irrespective of nationality (they could be Indians too), have great interview etiquettes. They smile, encourage you even if you go wrong, inform/apologize to you if they could not attend. You don't feel disheartened even in case of rejection. (I mean you would of course, but not because of some stupid interviewer who doesn't know to conduct an interview)\n\nBack here, I feel dejected, demotivated, frustrated if the interviewer was no good in his/her manners. \n\nNot saying there aren't good interviewers here, there are, but most of them still need lessons. I too, have interviewed and I make sure I don't hurt someone. \n\nSo, my dear juniors, if you encounter one harsh interviewer, just remember that person is worthless and it's good you have dodged a bullet by not going to be his/her colleague.   \nSecondly, in future, you too would get a chance to interview. Just be a good one. \n\nThat's all. \n\nP.S:  A friend recently shared her experience with a startup interview process, which brought back unpleasant memories for me. ",

To put things into perspective, in my Business Unit i.e. BFSI, we haven't got a single major project in 2023, but have lost a few good ones. My project also ended a few months ago, and I am on bench. Tried reaching out to a lot of managers, but they don't have any open positions for 1+ year experienced folks in their projects as well.\n\nThe people who are being asked to resign are getting a call from HR, where the HR says to share the screen, open the company portal, and resign from there. When people object, they threaten by saying that they won't give employee experience letter, etc.\n\nWhat steps can I take, when I get that call?\n\n(Edit: The company is Persistent Systems)",

        "Body": "Hey devs! So, I've always loved this sub, and I can see and sense all the frustrations of people searching for jobs, and especially in this market, it's tough, it really is. I recently went through it myself so I'm just putting up my process and journey out here, just in case some or any of you can find it helpful. I'll try and be as detailed as I can, but I won't be addressing anything that might even remotely reveal my idenitity, so believe this if you want but I'm not providing any sort of 'proof', take my word, or don't.\n\nAll applications were for a frontend developer job with around 2 YOE and with react as a mandatory requirement (for me, I didnt want to work with angular, vue etc), average range would 12-18 L, location - either bangalore or fully remote, didnt apply for any other city.\n\nImportant numbers / dates -\n\n* Old CTC - 13\n* New CTC - 16L plus ESOPs - I know its not a big bump but I'm very happy with it.\n* Old job left on Nov 2022\n* Time spent being on a break - 6 months, nov-april, where I didn't touch code or try to interview or prepare for interviews.\n* Job search started - May 2nd\n* First offer (taken) - June 14 - around 40 days from start to finish\n* Applications on wellfound \\- 80 , heard back from 9, 1 went to offer\n* Applications on linkedin \\- 30, heard back from 1 (after premium inmessage)\n* Applications on instahyre  \\- 100, heard back from 4 ( I rejected them all as they were all too far for me, commute was 3+ hours)\n* Applications on cutshort\\- \\~50 (mixture of them reaching out and me applying), heard back from 3\n* Applications on career websites - 22 (emails sent from me to careers@companyx etc), heard back from 1 (this is the offer I ended up taking)\n* Applications on other career sites (pyjama hr, workday etc) - \\~20, dont have an exact number for this, around 20 I guess, heard back from 0;\n* Take home assignments - 4, average time taken around 4-5 hours, 2 of these seenzoned me, 1 I left now because I already had an offer and wasnt interested further, 1 of them was the one that led to offer#2\n* Online assessments - 3, failed 2 and passed 1, the passed company just stalled me and the process never went anywhere, even after 2 weeks they were just asking for more time.\n* Face to face interviews - 19, this is the total meetings, including intro calls, etc from google calendar.\n* Face to face tech or tech-related interviews - 13\n* Bombed interviews - 3\n* Timeline for offer #1 (taken) - Call #1 intro call -> Call #2 tech round -> Call #3 with PM -> Call #4 with CTO, offer rolled out on the same day.\n* Timeline for offer #2 (not taken, but would have if #1 didnt exist) - Take home assignment -> Call #1 Tech round -> Call #3 CTO round -> Offer after 8 days - This company took too long, step 1 and 2 had 3 weeks b/w them, if they had been quicker I'd have been working there right now lol.\n\nI've listed all the sites already but heres how I would rank them, just my experience, your mileage may vary -\n\n1. Wellfound  \\- best for startups, 1-100 teams, good UI, has recently processed flag so you can tell which companies are active. Got the highest hit-rate here. Biggest con would be lack of good filters for INR and search and filter algos are out of whack most of the time.\n2. Career sites of companies - this is still the best way to things IMO, even though I received only 1 callback ( that did turn into the offer I'd take), I still think for early stage startups this is the best way to reach out, if you see an opening anywhere else, just go to the website, find their careers page/hr and email them, or linkedin message the HR/founder.\n3. Instahyre/cutshort - both are a draw, instahyre got me a few calls, but not for the companies I wanted, cutshort got me 3 good interviews but I screwed up 2 and the other is just stalled. Both the UIs are not great and esplly cutshort is very annoying to use. Instahyre's algorithm for matching jobs is very weird and it ranks you very low if you apply for a job it thinks you're not a good fit for, even when the JD feels like a great fit.\n4. LinkedIn - horrible, every new new job would have 100+ applicants within an hour, if I'm lucky, it could even be 1000+, none of my linkedin connects were any help, recruiters who were calling me for interviews before wouldnt even reply now, leaving me on seenzone lol honestly hate linkedin these days. Glad I dont have to go there anymore now.\n5. Didnt use - indeed, naukri. Why? Felt it was too crowded, and few startups and salary ranges were low and expectations were sky high.\n\nWhy I got as many callbacks as I did (my thoughts, I'm not an expert or anything)\n\n1. Simple resume - I used [flowcv](https://app.flowcv.com/) to make my resume, it was much less than 1 page, it was very very simple, clean and easy to read.\n2. Writing a custom CV for every application, without any AI, would spend 4-5 mins on their website, their JD, and try to customize it as much as possible. Nothing fancy or anything, just highlight keywords, skills, experience. Add a custom sentence about how I'll fit in well there, either culturally, with skills or whatever. Highlight unique things about you that might interest them, for me, it was immediate joining, no notice period is a good thing for small startups.\n3. Follow up with people on their linkedin - after 7-9 days if I didnt get a response from a job I wanted, Id find their linkedin and message them there, this has given me 2-3 responses on wellfound i.e they've replied on wellfound after I've messaged them on linkedin.\n4. Know your target companies, its not the JD that matters, its the people that are hiring and the kind of people they hire. Offer#1 said I need 3 YOE, which I definitely dont have, but I applied anyway, and here we are. Some companies are strict about these things, some aren't, you can sort of tell from their JD, glassdoor, linkedin etc.\n5. I would only apply for companies that had good glassdoor ratings OR had a good culture/about page, this increased my chances of getting shortlisted because they have something to lose by not keeping up their responses and they might actually be decent people. I never applied for any company with glassdoor rating lower than 4.\n6. No spam, I only applied for where I would join, so I always had some interest to follow up, send a proper CV and stay invested, not just click apply and forget it.\n\nMisteps -\n\n1. Being unprepared - BIG MISTAKE. BIG BIG MISTAKE. I started applying immediately after my break without any prep, and suddenly got a very good interview 4 days in and bombed it. If I didnt, I probably could have gotten a better package AND wouldn't have to suffer this stress for another 30+ days. FFS I curse myself everyday. Imagine getting a job the first week, it would have been amazing. Damn.\n2. Too much leetcode - Yes, leetcode is important, but for my role - Frontend, leetcode was minimal at startups, the very basic ones, easy mostly, they're important for online assessments thats bout it, wasted around a week trying to grind leetcode and I still couldnt understand anything and it never was an issue in interviews. THIS IS NOT TO SAY YOU DONT NEED GOOD DSA SKILLS. Basics like array manipulation, recursion, Dp are IMPORTANT. But mostly it was a combination of react with DSA instead of leetcode. Ex - render a component with a data object with n children.\n3. Building a portfolio project - built something with typescript and next.js hoping it will help me stand out, but nobody cared or asked about it, or if they did, they never told me, took 1 week, probably a waste of time, if you're an experienced dev, wouldnt bother, if you're a fresher this is very important.\n4. Scheduling multiple interviews in a day - I was in a hurry so I scheduled multiple calls in the same day, and it was bad, one of them went over by 40 mins and then i was tired and didnt do the next one very well. Thankfully I wasnt very into it but yeah, try and avoid this, or schedule them a lot of time apart.\n\nOverall some tips from me from what has worked for me -\n\n* Keep your resume simple, keep your cv simple, avoid AI, avoid spamming if you can.\n* Know your targets, culturally, ctc wise and tech wise.\n* Keep a number in your mind while negotiating but never say it firmly if you're truly interested, always say there's room for negotiation (if you're desperate for a job, otherwise, go for it)\n* For javascript and frontend specifically be very thorough on these topics  \nClosures, this object, prototype, events, event loop, callstack, let, var, const, basic OOP, css flex/grid, react virtual dom, why vdom, why react, what and how does diffing work. And practice gotcha questions and output based questions too, some of them ask random stuff. [react questions](https://github.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions), [js questions](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions)\n* For DSA - neetcode 75, should be okay for my range at least, more than problems understand the logic and be sure to communicate in interviews. In offer#1 I couldnt complete my tech assessment in time but they said I communicated it well enough that they were okay moving me up.\n* Be in a calm environment, drink some water during interviews. They're also just devs, try and be yourself, be casual, try and build a rapport, talk a lot and think more, code only when you're sure.\n* BE CAREFUL OF ONLINE ASSESSMENT PLATFORMS - so i failed 2 of my online tests, and I went to that platform and took a demo test and it would tell me I was cheating (eyes away, switched tabs, etc) even when I wasnt, be very careful and try and be facing the camera as much as possible and dont hit accidental keys lol.\n* If you get a take-home assignment, really weigh the benefits of doing it, if it takes a lot of time. 2 of my assignments ghosted me and I put significant time into it :(\n\nClosing thoughts -\n\nI rejected around 5-6 companies because of their strict wfo policy, or their office was very far from where I live (3h+ daily commute) IDK if they would have turned into offers, I was hopeful for one, the rest probably not. Nobody cared that I was on a break, I was only asked about it once and even they said it's fine, and personally it was a huge thing for me.Actually most of the tech people thought I was still at my last job, just goes to show that they dont really read resumes properly lol.\n\nGetting the initial call/email was the hardest, after callback/email, all the companies and recruiters I've talked to have been wonderful, I've learnt a lot about interviews, tech, companies and people in general. Everyone genuinely seemed like they wanted to help and I didnt come across any hostile or egoistic engineer or cto or recruiter either, they were all very cool, some of them reached out after I declined their offer/round and gave me their number for next time, 10/10 wholesome.\n\nThe past month was very stressful, my hairfall got exponentially worse and I had stress headaches too, but I never stopped trying, kept applying, and I never reduced my expected ctc, reaching out etc. I know a lot of you went through much worse, hang in there. Shout out to my family and friends, who were always supportive and never once doubted me. I did calm down after the first 3 weeks, and got more focused and less stressed but yeah, not a fun time. It almost reversed all the fun I had in my break.\n\nFinally, this might be a very bitter or harsh thing to say, and if you wanna downvote me, go ahead, but there are jobs, there are companies, lots of them, most of the companies I interviewed said they're having a hard time finding good candidates, if you're not getting callbacks, it's not the market, yes, its relatively bad right now, especially for freshers, but you still can get a job.\n\nIt's either your skills, your resume, your way of reaching out, your job platform or a combination of all of those. Finding a job is a skill in itself. It is. Blind applying on linkedin, grinding leetcode and crying about it to my network wont do jack shit for me. If you're 1/20000 applicants, you're getting nowhere. Know where you can apply to maximize your odds, hopefully this post helps with that.\n\nHaving said that, hiring is broken in India, it really is, so don't be too hard on yourself, its fucked up on both sides. But that's the reality, you have to function within that, find ways to beat the system, whatever that is.\n\nSorry if this is too long or too short, I didnt really structure this well, like I'm lazy and I'm tired but I wanted to make this just in case it helped someone, so if you have any questions please ask here in the comments so it can be helpful for others as well, but like I said, I'm not giving any personal info about any of this. Pls don't send me your resumes, if you want me to review them, make an anonymous version (remove all personal info) and share that, I'll try to give my inputs.\n\nPutting \"Not looking\" into all these websites was the best feeling haha.\n\nI hope this was helpful, I'm too lazy to do that data flow thingy and all, all these numbers are approx from me literally counting them lol, but yeah general picture, I've tried to be as transparent as I can be. I truly hope you find your job soon if you're looking, it's really hell to be in that position, hang in there, keep going, you'll get there.

For example after bombarding me with tons of technical doubts and finishing his story.\n\nHe started to look into the code and reading through all of it and then when he find some commit message that is wrong or some small flaw in a function name or code (nothing big but just small minor semantic changes here and there), he pings me with a \"I found this, kindly check.\" As if he's my boss or something.\n\nI have written a lot of code and all of that has passed QA and many things are in UAT and production. I value my time and fix things when something breaks in QA or when I am writing code for some story and related function or a piece of code has some problem.\n\n\nI feel that he's new so he is feeling this need to prove himself or something and trying to do things which lead to a good resume for him or something which might not be wrong.. but I don't want to ruin my work life balance for his goals.\n\nI feel somewhat stupid now for answering his doubts and teaching him to be honest, I feel like bailing and avoiding him in the future wherever I can.\n\nIs my mindset wrong?\n\nHow should I deal with this junior.",

I usually start work at 10 AM & leave the office at around 9 PM at night, there is one colleague who stays 11-12 PM at night with the manager and bad mouths everyone on the team, he told my skip manager that I leave early from office &  start late.  This led my skip manager to fire me b/c he thinks I am not working office hours, wtf, how many hours do they want me to work 24/7?\n\nThis company is a very early-stage startup(they don't even have any page/website/LinkedIn page) and people there work their asses off, sometimes, I have seen people stay at 1-2 AM at night. So, most of the managers expect people to stay late at night and work. There is no exit timing but the start timing is fixed at 10 - 11 AM.\n\nI am not sure what to do now, I am fresher, and looking at the job market I don't think I will be able to get a job very soon.\n\nCan anyone guide me on how to land a job? any openings anywhere?  \n\n\nEDIT - The founders of the company live in the USA so most of the meetings are scheduled late at night IST. So people are forced to stay at night time due to meetings.  \nFounders don't care about the meeting timing or they don't bother to schedule the meeting at IST time they do it whenever they want it.  \nPeople are still working here b/c most of them are freshers or 1-2 years old & couldn't find any job in better companies due to cutthroat competition & saturated job market.

First 6 months there was bench, lost my will to learn, was sleeping all time due to wfh then allocated to a toxic project now being a slog to working 13-14 hours I got frustrated and resigned without offer but after struggle got offer in another WITCH at 14LPA. So basically stayed for 1 year in 2nd company.\n\nIn 3rd company for 1 year work was very light and great team but nothing new. From this year they transferred me to devops from development.\n\nSo my concern is after 5 years and at 14LPA  I don't know anything properly. I somehow make things work you can say hindi word JUGAAD. If you will compare I haven't learnt nothing new in last 2 years and have become so lazy. Sometimes I google, take help from teammates etc and eventually trying to sustain but honestly speaking I don't even know the basic of technologies I have been working upon and since my experience is increasing I don't think I can sustain like this longer but I will have to make this work since I have analysed and I have no other option left.\n\nI also suffer from imposter syndrome, always get a feeling my teammates will get to know that I don't have basic technical knowledge also and will get fired desoite of several appreciation mails and accolades I think I am lucky dumbass who somehow got it and they will know the truth soon.\n\nSince I got transferred to Devops, I want to give my career a restart. How to work on my career? \n\nI want to dedicate myself and switch to a product based company and really become good af what I do.\n\nI know there are many people who became zero to hero here...pls help me how to progress in my career.\n\nSince lots of people asked my skills are mentioned below:\n\nLanguages - Python, Node.js, \nPlatforms - AWS, Azure, \nTools - Git, Docker & Kubernetes, \nDB - Postgresql, Mysql\n\nBut keep in mind I am not at all pro in any of these skills, just somehow making things work since 5 years.",

        "Id": "18p3ipg",
        "Body": "Aloha, folks.\n\nThroughout all the years I've been programming in C, I've come across a lot-- and I mean a LOT-- of incorrect articles and videos on C that promise to teach you the language. In fact, majority of the stuff out there on the internet on the language is guaranteed to help you with your rituals of summoning nasal demons. If you're expecting to learn C from your school or college, don't hold onto that hope either. Most schools and colleges, at least in India, will teach you incorrect C. Even courses like Harvard's CS50 is, quite unfortunately, not an exception, at least when it comes to the parts where it teaches you the language. I've read a couple of books on C as well, including the (in)famous Let Us C, and most of them were filled with false information. Let Us C was definitely the worst of the bunch though; in fact, I have yet to come across a book worse than that. I've also seen a lot of folks learning the language from sites like geeksforgeeks and javatpoint, and if you're one of those people, I'd recommend you to stay 4 miles away from these sites.\n\nNow, as for what you _should_ do to learn _correct_ C: if you're not familiar at all with the language, The C Programming Language (2nd Edition), though very much outdated, might help you to get started. Then you should select a version of C you would like to learn. I started with C11, and C11 and C17 are still my personal favorites. If you're a beginner and are wondering which would be the best version to learn, there is not any \"best\" version, but I'd recommend starting with C17. If you're a student and can't yet buy the standards, there exist draft versions of them [here](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html). Some of them are pretty similar to the final standards, and you can read them for absolutely free.\n\nThe standards aren't really meant for beginners, so once you've selected a specific version, visit [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), apply the `C` tag-- and optionally a version-specific one as well-- and start reading random questions on the language, especially the ones tagged `language-lawyer`. This helped me quite a bit when I first started learning the language; you will come across a lot of things that you didn't know about before. While doing this, continue reading the standard on the side. You will never understand a specific concept on the first read, so keep on reading until you are confident enough you have understood (and interpreted, since some of the statements in the standard can be a bit vague) it right.\n\nThe previous two paragraphs mostly apply to beginners. If you're somebody who writes C for a living and haven't yet read a standard, I'd recommend you to do so. The amount of non-confroming code I have seen some people who claim to be using C for 15 or so years write, still baffles me. Reading a standard doesn't take that long.\n\nTL;DR\n1. Read the standard for whatever version of C you're using.\n3. If you can't buy a standard yet, there exist free drafts of them [here](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html).\n4. If you're a beginner, The C Programming Language (2nd Edition) and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) are good resources, even though the former might be a bit outdated.\n5. Avoid sites like geeksforgeeks and javatpoint if you're learning C.\n6. Avoid Let Us C and similar books.\n7. Avoid CodeWithHarry, Neso Academy, Technology Gyan, Apna College, and others for learning C.\n8. Schools and colleges will very likely teach you incorrect C.\n\nEdit: For people wanting to know why I claimed the specific sources I talked about in my post to be spreading incorrect information, I will write a separate post on them along with relevant standard references for the language lawyers out there soon. It's hard to cram all of them in the comments.",

        "Body": "Hello fellow devs,\n\nI'd like to share our startup story with you today, and it comes with mixed emotions as we bid farewell to our very first venture. (TL;DR at the bottom)\n\nMe and my 5 friends (5 from B.Tech. and 1 from B.Tech + LLB) had a brilliant idea. However, we made our fair share of rookie mistakes right from the start. \n\nOur very first (And the biggest) mistake was that we didn't do any sort of market research. We just came to the conclusion that if we think people need this then people actually need this.... \n\nOur second mistakle: Didn't plan anything.  We coded away without a clear plan in mind. The result? An absolute mess, 5 noob coders with vastly different coding styles and no professionalism. Oh god the code base was garbage. We all agreed it was shiiit. We realized our mistake and began again, this time with a better plan, resulting in a codebase that, while not perfect, was at least serviceable. It took us a year and a half to get to this point. \n\nFinally, when we got the tech resolved we started searching for the investers. It's extremely hard to even get a chance to talk to the investors when you are 19yo second year studfent from a tier 3 college. Those interested in investing were demanding a staggering 75% stake in our company \u2013 an offer we couldn't accept.\n\nWe got tired of investor hunting and thought let's bootstrap it (Turns out it was a good idea in the end). We pooled our resources, registered the company, purchased a domain, and launched the website. \n\nThird mistake: We thought an investor only brings money to the company. But NO!!! they also bring connection and experience, I regularly think it might have been different if we had an investor with industry connection and industry experience.\n\nInitially, we experienced some success, likely due to the support of our family, college friends, and teachers. However, our earnings were far from substantial, and it took us eight months to break even. \n\nUnfortunately, things took a turn for the worse after eight to nine months. Our customer base dwindled, returning customers became scarce, and new customers from ads barely stuck around. We were barely breaking even and heading downhill fast. \n\nLast Sunday, we held a final meeting and collectively decided to shut down the company. Starting on Monday, we began the process of winding down our services: we surrendered the domain, deleted the database, took down the hosting, archived the GitHub repository, and closed our mailing service account. We also initiated the cancellation of our GST registration. While the technical aspects are sorted out, there's still some legal work to complete. As I write this, I've just closed the last chapter by shutting down our mailing service account. Now, I'm pondering what's next.\n\nBecause we kept the company bootstrapped we have zero debt, and no pressure from any investor.\n\nI have a job, so I'm not unemployed, but our startup used to be the driving force that motivated me to return home early from the office and continue working in the evening. Now, my evenings will be empty. \n\nNonetheless, I'm grateful for this experience. We learned a great deal, not only about technology but also about the legal intricacies of running a company. We learned from our mistakes. \n\nNow, it's on to a new adventure: brainstorming a better startup idea and starting all over again. I don't wanna giveup on my startup dream. I believe someday I'll have a brilliant startup and It will be succesfull.\n\nTL;DR (Generated by ChatGPT): A group of friends started a startup without market research or a clear plan, leading to a messy codebase. Investor struggles and a lack of connections added to the challenges. Initial success with support from friends, but later a decline in customers forced them to shut down. They learned valuable lessons and now plan to start a new venture, undeterred by the past. ",

I can only speak for myself, I\u2019ve worked on building some amazing applications which are optimal too, ask me about core Java, ask me about framework, hell even ask me about how all the internal things work in core and I can give you answer, but I\u2019m not even getting that chance to even let them know I\u2019m good at these things, these are the areas I\u2019m expertise on and I can really be good at what I do. This is so depressing and makes me feel am I not good enough. End of rant, thanks.\n\nAlso, please suggest me any companies where they actually test what you know rather than the ones your  leetcode grind.\n\nEdit: People asking to working on it, I\u2019m doing it, constantly learning and solving leetcode slowly. But it does not come naturally to everyone, it takes time, that\u2019s where I am at.\n\nEdit2: My problem is on companies basing their decision factor of hiring or not is 100% based on a solving a DSA problem, not even giving opportunity for candidate to showcase their projects, their experience, their knowledge in actual work they do, just why not.",

        "Id": "15n5kad",
        "Body": "So some of the companies that I've recently seen and also heard from some peers, are hiring techies at exorbitantly high salaries, which is fine. But then they are axing existing techies who are doing the same amount and quality of work at the same role for a much lower salary.\n\nI understand that a company might need to cut costs but logically shouldn't they be letting go of the high-paid individuals who have newly joined and have no clear understanding of the job yet.\n\nOne reason that I could think of behind these kind of layoffs is the age of the existing employees. Most of these comparitively underpaid employees are either getting old (say late 30s or early 40s) or are veterans in a company, so if a company wants to only hire fresh faces, then it makes sense to fire the existing. But I don't think many companies care so much about optics.\n\nAnother reason could be this weird fetish of hiring as many laid-off FAANG devs as possible at matching (or higher) salaries for roles and levels that are currently being handled by folks for much much less pay. Imagine a colleague with lesser experience than you working on same tech stack and delivering same quality work but getting paid thrice your salary. And when the push comes to shove,  it's the existing employee that's thrown out first! It's a terrible practice. \n\nAre such layoffs common? What do you think could be the reason for such layoffs?",

I would definitely need some help from the experienced techies to scale this cause. Time to give back to the community folks! Drop me a DM if you can connect to the cause.",

        "Body": "This  has been bugging for some time. For the context, I came back to  development (has past experience of 5 years) as a backend lead for a  tech startup with a gap of around 4 years. Couple of things about the  tech team was that almost all of them were competent with good sense of  ownership. I enjoyed working with most of the folks and was pleasantly  surprised with most of them, with how they are able to pick up tasks  despite their less experience.\n\nAfter  a couple of months, I had to lead a team with a junior dev (1.5 yrs  exp, 2nd company). From the start, I was impressed with the enthusiasm  she had shown, however, noticed that outcome is no where. I talked to  her and came to realise that the tech stack of the current company(node)  is different from her previous(Java). She said that she was struggling  with node and has been juggling multiple teams internally (she was already  working with the company for 6+ months).\n\nI  always felt that node is one of the easiest ~~languages~~ to pick up.  Nevertheless, I asked her to brush up on her skills in node and asked  her to work on a mock project (simple crud application using express)  for a couple of weeks so that she will get more comfortable with node. I  covered her tasks during that time. However even after the project, I did not  find any tangible improvement where I felt comfortable to give tasks to.\n\nI  used to allocate tasks which could be easily done irrespective of  personal skill and noticed that she was having trouble with even those  tasks. So I got on a personal chat with her (this is like 1+ month post  her joining my team), tried to explain some basics of node and asked her to take a week for going through the existing code base. After  the week, I asked her to take up a task which involves minor change in  the existing code base, which she was not able to. Now I began to doubt  if she had even put in effort to understand the code base. So I asked  her to explain the flow of the code base, which she failed miserably.\n\nThis  is where I lost my cool to a certain extent as I felt that the trust I  had put on her has not been reciprocated. I have always been candid with my colleagues with regards to their work/skill and I personally always  believe that feedback (good or bad) is needed to grow professionally and  individually. I gave a brutally honest and candid feedback on her  skills. However, communication is not my strong suite and  unintentionally I may have been too on the face (borderline aggressive  and came strongly according to her) which might have made her feel  uncomfortable.\n\nAfter couple of  weeks, the director of engineering (whom I report to) had a chat with me with regards to her performance  and I gave my feedback honestly. We then put her on a unofficial PIP for  1 month, which involves some code refactor and some  future enhancements we are planning to do on the project which she has  now worked for more than 2.5 months. Post this PIP, I observed she was  able to improve quite a bit, but not to the extent that we can be  comfortable with providing tasks independently. I shared my feedback  with the director again, who shared it with HR.\n\nPost  this we had to put her on official PIP for a time period of 1 more  month. This time, the PIP involved existing project and a new project. I  observed some more improvement but again not to the extent which is  enough in my opinion, where she can take tasks independently. I shared  the same with the director and HR. Post this, HR decided to fire her.\n\nIt  is at this point that she complained to HR that I was verbally  aggressive towards her on one occasion. HR reported the same to  director and director informed me about the same. Till this point, I  felt that I was harsh with the feedback but never felt that I crossed  the line (which obviously was not the case as per her experience) and  felt shocked. The director vouched for my character with the HR. I then  mailed to the junior explaining that it was never my intention to make  her feel uncomfortable and I felt that the feedback though harsh was  within professional limits. Nevertheless, I apologized sincerely that  she had to go through such an unpleasant experience and that I will take  it as a feedback and improve myself. However, I always felt that I was  more or less giving a corporate apology just in case it became a bigger  issue.\n\nThis happened last year  November/December, but the whole thing has left a big impression on me,  doubting myself. Though, I stand by my feedback, I always felt may be I  could have handled the whole thing much better and could have a helped  out a junior just like my seniors have done when I was in a similar  position.\n\nSo fellow  developers/managers, assuming that I am white washing a lot of details  just to make myself feel better what is the road not taken by me here.  Be as honest on what I could improve and how you may have handled this  scenario.\n\nTLDR courtesy of u/[Neck-Pain-Dealer](https://www.reddit.com/user/Neck-Pain-Dealer/)\n\n>Experienced backend lead at a startup, struggled to see progress in a  junior developer who had difficulty adapting to a new tech stack.  Despite offering guidance and setting up improvement plans, the junior's  performance did not meet expectations. The writer gave candid feedback,  unintentionally coming across as aggressive. The junior eventually  complained to HR about the aggression, leading to doubts and  self-reflection for the writer. The situation was resolved by HR, but  the experience left the writer questioning their approach and seeking  advice on how to handle such scenarios better in the future.",

I had a client interview at a company yesterday after completing two technical interviews.\n\nOut of curiosity and impatience, I tried to push my HR to get an update on the client interview by Monday.

I am sure on how this mail would have given ugly impression to the entire team.\n\nI did the best throughout all my interviews for this company.

        "Id": "158codn",
        "Body": "There are so many languages and frameworks. LinkedIn and Twitter are filled with diverse opinions and advice for young engineers. There are debates around DSA vs development, backend vs frontend, OOP or no OOP.\n\nIt can be too much to process for someone just getting into the world of tech.\n\nThe cherry on top - there are only a limited number of jobs. Resume selection in itself is a huge mountain. As a college student, you are expected to have internships, projects, extracurriculars and a 90 percentile CGPA.\n\nHow can someone not feel like giving up? My suggestion: Focus on TODAY. Pick ONE language + ONE framework.\n\nEverything else, the concepts and logic can be implemented in other languages with some syntax tweaks.\n\nIf you are confused about which language to pick, some of the most popular options are:\n\n1. Java + SprinBoot\n2. Python + Django\n3. Ruby + Rails (reach out to me if you aren't sure which language is best suited for you)\n\nAfter working with some of the best in the field, I realised that longevity comes down to two things primarily (of course, it is an oversimplification, but hear me out) -\n\n1. Curiosity\n2. Consistency\n\nPlan for today.\n\n* Make a commitment that\u00a0*'I will learn {insert a programming concept, eg: HashMap} today'*.\n* Don't overcommit. Start small.\n* Make incremental progress. Remember the famous maths: 1.01\\^365 >>> 0.99\\^365.\n\nCheck if you are good on your promise when you end your day. If not, the day hasn't ended for you.\n\n**This is the consistency part.**\n\nDon't just try to solve the problem. Know the fundamentals - what are they used for? What can we do with the concepts? Who invented them? What was the motivation behind the invention?\n\nLet's take an example of a queue - it's FIFO (first in first out). Think of the big billion days on Flipkart. There are 100 phones on sale and 1000 concurrent buyers. How would you avoid double sale of the same item?\n\n**This is the curiosity part.**\n\nLastly, try not to fall into the trap of comparing your journey with someone else. You don't know the full context. If you are trying your best, that's good enough. Looking at everything at once can and will make you anxious.\n\nWe have tried to make learning programming super fun by focussing on curiosity and consistency, at SkillCaptain. Learn one concept every day, practise it with an example and get your assignment reviewed by mentors like me. If you are starting to learn from zero and want to reach a point where you create your REST APIs, you can explore\u00a0[skillcaptain.app](http://skillcaptain.app/),\u00a0[tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm),\u00a0[educative.io](https://www.educative.io/).

Also I will try to create a syllabus for the first few months to tell you what exactly I am planning to teach. This course might be good for someone who is beginning. Not for someone who knows coding and just needs mentorship. I will see what I can do for all the mentorship requests too.\n\nI want to teach and mentor a few people starting early January or late December.\n\n**About the course**\n\nWe won't be following bootcamp style topics. First few months, I will be teaching you how to program using python (or racket) and we will be learning problem solving and coding. Once you are comfortable with coding, every student will be given an option to choose what they want to learn next (web dev / mobile development / or something else). Then I will teach ideas around those topics and mentor you on those topics. Idea is to get you comfortable learning and working on technology you need to. Come with an idea of what you want to build and we will help you build that.\n\nSo assume a month or 2 to get comfortable with coding. And the next 4-6 months to get comfortable on the topic of your interest.\n\nI can only manage around 5 to 10 people in the first cohort as it is the first time and I want to see if I can do justice to everyone.\n\n**Cost :** None, just your time.\n\n**For**\n\nFor anyone interested in learning coding. You could be some one trying to switch a career, or a PM trying to learn coding or some one just want to launch a startup. All that matters is that you are motivated and have time.\n\n**Pre-requisites**\n\n\\- Motivation and belief to learn.\n\n\\- Perseverance to continue learning even on bad days.\n\n**Gotchas**\n\n\\- I cannot promise that I can motivate you to learn.\n\n\\- I cannot promise an interview call. Companies are weird when recruiting people with non-traditional background. But we will build a portfolio for each one of you.\n\n**Why**\n\nI am planning to take a break from Jan 2024. I have always wanted to mentor / teach others. But never tried it before. So thought of giving it a go now. Also the idea of making a positive change to someone else's life is intriguing.\n\n**About me**\n\nEx-google. But never felt comfortable working in office environment. Freelancing as a mobile developer for quite some time. Comfortable with mobile / web development. Currently trying to learn ML / AI.\n\nIf you are interested,  please feel free to reply to this post or DM me a bit about you and why you want to learn coding. Even if you want to stay anonymous, It is fine. We will mostly be conducting it using Zoom and Discord and you can continue remaining anonymous till you are comfortable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sorry** could not respond to all of you yet. It blew up beyond my expectations. I will surely respond to you one by one.\n\n**Answers to common questions asked till now**\n\n\\- You don't need any background in coding or tech. Just motivation to learn.\n\n\\- I was hoping to help people who don't know coding to learn coding.  I received a lot of requests from people who know coding already. I will respond to each and every one of you and have a plan.\n\n\\- Classes would be mostly on Saturdays (and some Sundays) for 2 hours. And then there will be assignments for you to try. I will always be available on discord to respond to your doubts.\n\n\\- Mostly you will need to put in at max 10 hours per week.\n\n\\- Initially it would be concentrated on problem solving and coding in a language (mostly python or racket). Once you are comfortable, switching languages should be easy. Will make sure that you can learn other languages easily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "Id": "12fbp74",
        "Body": "Rant:\n\nMyself a Fullstack developer currently working in a small company in chennai on remote. Need to go office once a week. The salary is 15.5LPA for 7 years of experience with a wife and 4 year old kid. The thing is what to choose at this point of time, I'm somewhat happy with my salary. I get around 1.1Lpm after tax and wife earns around 25K. our expenses are only 30K so we save around 1L monthly chennai.\n\n In current company the WLB is so good that I can logout at 6pm daily without thinking about issues. The job is also somewhat challenging with work spanning from dotnet, azure, terraform etc. \n\nNow whenever I look into reddit / fishbowl I can see large pay for some juniors with a less experience. I feel like I have a good capacity to earn well if I switch companies. But the comfort zone the amount of WLB I get from this company makes me to worry what happens if i switch company. I also given some interview the things is companies are ready to give only upto 20LPA in chennai location. Many calls which i receive is from bangalore who are ready to give 25LPA.\n\nso im highly confused between whether what to choose a happy life with a okay pay. Move out of comfort zone like moving from chennai to bangalore for a high pay. So i can reach good level in life. \n\nOn moving to bangalore things that may take a toll are the rent, child education, support from family when we are not feeling well, wife might leave her job or I can move alone and visit to chennai couple of weeks. \n\nI don't know how married devs take the decisions kind of breaking my head on what to go forward makes me sleepless. \n\nSorry for silly rant i need a place to vent out.",

        "Id": "14d65vp",
        "Body": "This is something I have been willing to ask people for a long time now.\n\nAlmost all big and good product companies and startups are moving or opening offices in Bangalore. Recruiters reach out for jobs based out of Bangalore only. I also see a lot of colleagues and acquaintances moving there for lucrative jobs\n\nWhile I agree that Bangalore has the best weather in  India out of all major cities, and even the best opportunities for CS folks or developers in general. And, boy! people who have moved to Bangalore never fail to boast about it \"we have the best weather, best air, highest paying packages\"\n\nBut don't you guys think you're only killing that city? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery day companies are expanding in Bangalore, some are closing offices in other cities and consolidating  all their staff in Bangalore itself. this will put a lot of burden on already struggling infrastructure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I have questions for different categories of people:  \n\n\n**To the founders, decision makers, leaders of companies of startups here**: Why not try other cities? I believe a lot of you are moving to Bangalore because you get good talent there. But don't you know that talent is also moving there because you guys are going there? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**To people who are looking for jobs:** If you can afford to, why don't you say no to the recruiters who say we only have Bangalore location? Why give in to the companies' pressure if you can get similar jobs in other cities which may be closer to your hometowns? (like Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon, Noida, Hyderabad, etc). They are hiring for Bangalore because talented people like you go there in huge numbers. If more people start declining it, companies will start expanding to other cities, maybe even tier 2 cities someday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**To the local administration**: Instead of building IT park after IT park in Bangalore itself. first spend money on improving infrastructure to sustain the existing load of the city. why inviting more companies to setup companies when you already know traffic situation is hell in your city?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**to the central government (not sure if message will ever reach them)** : why are you not trying to spread out this industry? give incentives to companies for setting up offices in smaller cities, and stop incentivizing them for setting up in Bangalore (or other cities with infra issues)  \n\n\nLooking to hear views. i am sure I am not thinking about a lot of logistic, economical issues etc here, but things can be worked out if people have intention. But bigger point is, people like us, developers, will have to speak out and not give in to companies just moving everything or setting up everything in Bangalore. they don't really care about employees spending 4 hours everyday in travelling (btw. thats 20 hours every week. If you take leaves for about 3 weeks in a year, you're spending 1000 hours travelling in a year, thats 41 days of your life per year). their senior folks have money to get homes near offices to reduce travel time, but they really don't care about people who can't afford that\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***PS: I am not against Bangalore. In fact, it is more about saving Bangalore from greed of governments and corporates***\n\n  \n",

        "Id": "15y2etv",
        "Body": "I'm a regular self-taught developer working at a small-time service company with 1.5 YOE.\n\nToday I learned firsthand what is the difference between a problem solver and someone who writes code (strictly in my reference). \n\nMy first preference as a 29 YO guy was to secure a better-paying job, for that, I was learning a particular stack and made some projects using those. Interviewers liked those side-projects and interviewed me about my current job profile and my knowledge of the frameworks and languages. Some gave me problems to solve, some gave me assignments to make, and some asked me to create a small webpage or API during the interview. \n\nBut today's Power Programmer interview was something different. This was the second round with someone senior(20+ YOE) at Infosys. The interviewer and I introduced each other. Then he briefly explained to me the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of a Power Programmer **(he referred to it as a part of the Strategic Development Team)** and how it barely constitutes 1% of Infosys' development workforce. \n\nA bit of context. In round 1, I was asked to solve a problem (along with other Language and Framework specific questions) which I solved. After the interview, when I was looking for an optimized solution, I came to know that this problem is known as **3Sum Closest(Dynamic Programming)** on LeetCode. \n\nDuring my limited time, even though I have a fair understanding of basic Data Structures and different types of Algorithms (I'm currently reading Introduction To Algorithms by Cormen) I didn't prioritize solving problems. \n\nAnyways back to the second round, the first problem was a simple one. But the interviewer explicitly said that I'm only looking for an approach and not the whole solution instead. I took some time refactoring the code to make it more readable. This was the type of question that someone with a basic understanding of the if-else construct would easily solve.\n\nThe second problem was the Largest Common Substring problem which again used Dynamic Programming. But this time I was stuck. I somehow managed to come up with a partial solution. But unlike the last round, I couldn't solve it. So the interviewer was kind enough to make me go through the whole algorithm iteration by iteration. Finally, he asked me to write the code that would create such iterative results, which I somehow managed to do (I still doubt my final code).\n\nI was able to follow the logic he was trying to convey, but I was so not ready for such an interview. \n\nIn the back of my head, I was like Damn! I got such an amazing opportunity, but 6 months earlier :D\n\nI realized that the whole interview was only focused on problem-solving and problem-solving alone.\n\nFinally, after 1 hour, the interviewer gave me some feedback, which was nothing just keep on doing whatever I am doing and get better at it, along with some appreciation about my past.\n\nI know my outcome, but it's the experience that made me flair this post as a Personal Win (apologies if it doesn't go by its definition) and I wanted to share this with the community and get your thoughts on this.\n\nI was presented with an opportunity and I missed it because I was way too much under-prepared. I'll focus more on problem-solving in next upcoming months and will apply for this role again, and who knows!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore Context - I am Mechanical Engineering Grad with 5 years of gap between my first job. But None of these two factors were ever questioned in any of my interviews to date.",

I recently received news that I have been selected for a 2M summer internship at a considerably big company (not MAANG but pays the same) with frankly speaking, insane stipend. I have never heard of this amount of money being paid as a stipend before, I was comfortable with earning like 1/4th of this money for my summer intern if I even managed to get one in the first place. And now that I have been selected for this, I feel happy but also very very scared. Because apparently, there is also a chance for a PPO and I looked up the avg salary of a SDE 1 at this company on AmbitionBox and it blew my mind. My family has never seen this kind of money before and it would be a very big deal for me to get in financially, especially in the early parts of my career. The thing is, I have never interned at an established place before so I do not know how to crack PPOs. It is pretty obvious that this kinda opportunity is quite rare in the market these days. Hence I do not want to blow this away now that luck has finally struck in my favour. I know interns probably are not taken seriously in most companies and that's why I think I will have to stand out. I do not doubt my abilities but as I said I do not have experience working at a big company before and would love it if someone could help me out with a few pointers, I absolutely cannot fuck this up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Gonna intern this summer at a company which pays a lot, have never interned at a big company before and would like to crack PPO, how to go about doing that? I would most likely be assigned to a backend team btw which is good for me since I am a backend developer.",

        "Body": "So I attended an interview a few hours ago and the over enthusiasm led to me telling the interviewer that I had started a smma with my friends a few months ago to the \"tell me about yourself\" question. He started asking more questions like ok so how much do yall make etc etc...  \n\nAfter that, he told me all concerned that it is not allowed in any company to work anywhere else. I understand the non-compete policy, but I thought it was only applicable if one works in the same domain. This was more part-time, passive income that's based on deisgn and not tech, but he kept on insisting that it is not allowed to have any sort of clientele. He asked me why I needed another job when I already had one. I tried explaining that I m ambitious, and my small venture doesn't stop me from pursuing a full-time job where I can learn more about the corporate world and upskill myself. After a while he told me that he is not able to put a finger on his decision because eventhough he thinks I m otherwise perfect for his team, he also feels like I wouldn't stay long term with them or would do fine even without the job. This was the technical round, btw.   \n\nNow, two things. 1. I m not looking to join this company because they have absurd work timings(1-10, 2-11,5-3), or maybe it's only absurd to me. But they also have really good growth internall,  so I feel like I would miss out on that if I decide not to join. So now it's not like I want i,  but I also don't want to lose i,  ykwim\n\n2. I know I know I know I should be more diplomatic in my answer,  but this tim,  I feel like I was honest rather than diplomatic with my answers. I need a poker face fr.

I like my job and am optimistic about my growth and career progression in this field. \n\nBut my parents have been pressurizing me to give Govt job exams like UPSC, state services, Assistant Engineer etc. I understand where this is coming from. My parents grew up in a middle class family in the Hindi Heartland (MP, UP etc) and all they have seen are Govt babus who are corrupt, wield influence and respect (Isn't it ironic how our society tends to \"respect\" those who are the most corrupt). I have repeatedly told them that I don't want to work in the Govt because of it's corrupt system, political interference, poor work life balance, limited freedom to work, strict hierarchies and of course limited pay (also reservation in promotions). Also UPSC is such an uncertain, poorly structured exam ki kab jawani ke 5 saal barbaad ho jaenge pata bhi nahi chalega. Why to waste your most productive youth years preparing for a Govt exam? It might be the case in pre 1991 era (limited provate sector opportunities) but now the opportunity cost is just too high to ignore for a GEM IITian.\n\nBut somehow, these reasons are not enough to convince them. I know most of you must have been in this exact same situation. How did you go about bringing this mindset shift in your parents?\n\nEdit_1: Ok, since some people are suggesting me to prepare for UPSC alongside my job, I think some context is necessary. I did not sit for placements in my 4th year as I was preparing for UPSC (I was naive that time, probably was in a bubble and got too influenced by society and parents). Gave an attempt, it did not work out. Decided that I cannot do this to myself and let my prime years go to waste (parents were super supportive here). Then I switched to tech industry and got a full time SDE role via LinkedIn. So, UPSC was my past which I am never revisiting again. But cannot say the same for my parents.",

        "Id": "1bgdjo3",
        "Body": "I am writing this experience after a few months since it happened, mostly because I was busy in my interviews. This happened in the month of Sept. The whole thing started around 15th of september when I received a mail communication from Agoda HR team and they wanted to schedule my first round. I had applied through their website and they liked the profile. There was no call regarding my expectations, role to be offered, location or anything. A scheduling link was sent directly. I accepted the invite and scheduled the interview after one week (this was as soon as I could).\n\nFirst round happened at 21st and it went pretty good. At the end of the discussion I asked my interviewer about the basic information of role like location, seniority, technology. Since he was from the bangkok team he did not have this information and also couldn't get me in touch with the recruiter.\n\nThe HR team went completely silent for 1 and a half week. No response, no feedback, nothing. After almost 10 days of gap I got another similar mail asking me to schedule the second round. Please note, till this point I did't have any conversation with my recruiter. I again scheduled it after a week (earliest). This round was also taken from someone from Bangkok and it went pretty well too. The HR team again went ghost. After almost 2 weeks, I got a call from the HR that my rounds were clear and they want to move ahead.\n\nThe same thing happened with next 2 interviews. They took atleast 7-10 days to come back for each round and then take 5 more days to schedule the round. I had already spent close to 50 days to complete my 4 rounds.\n\nAfter completing 4 rounds, HR team kept a introductory round where they asked me for my expectations in terms of salary. They said that the panel is still reviewing my interviews and they will soon get back to me with final results. I tried to contact them twice after a couple of days but no reply.\n\nAnother week passed by.\n\nThen they came back saying that they want to keep a director round to which I agreed. They said that he is currently in Bangkok and we would be able to schedule this next week, to which again, I agreed.\n\nAnother week passed by and I finally gave my final round.\n\nAgain, after 3-4 days (really really fast this time :P) I received that the overall feedback was positive and they would like to move ahead with the offer.\n\nNext day, I got a call from one of the Senior HRs and discussed salary. They were offering quite low from what I was asking for and we agreed on a middle number.  \nAgain next day, I got a call from the same person and said they can't do what we agreed on a day back, and they would only offer a slightly lower number, to which I agreed.\n\nAfter a couple of days, when I followed up for the offer letter, I got a call from the same HR person.  \nShe informed me that they will not be going ahead with me since they have stopped hiring engineers for my position and said they will only look for Staff/Principal level engineers for GGN location.\n\nI was extermely pissed. Literally 2.5 months of interview process including interviews, so many followups, calls, negotiations, feedbacks, NOW you are informing me that you are not hiring for my level.\n\nI can't even imagine how messed up things at a company have to be to treat their potential employees like this.  \nImagine the state of tech and engineering at a place where hiring process is so so inefficient and messed up.  \nI thank the almighty I didn;t get into that company, although at one point I had almost made up my mind to join them.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nTL;DR (thanks chatGPT)\n\nTL;DR:  \nWent through a lengthy interview process with Agoda, enduring delays and poor communication from the HR team. After multiple rounds and negotiations, was told they weren't hiring for the position they interviewed for. Frustrated by the inefficient process and glad to not join the company.",

        "Body": "This might be a rant post, but I've wanted to share this for over a year now, and I believe it's something everyone here needs to know! The Internet Freedom Foundation (https://internetfreedom.in/) has been fighting single-handedly for internet freedom, digital rights, privacy, and data protection in India for over a decade. They've been vocal about how every issue and law that is discussed and passed affects our lives. They take up litigations, engage in policy advocacy, and promote public awareness and education. They have a robust team of lawyers and policy experts who dissect complex bureaucratic matters and help ordinary people like us understand what everything means and how it impacts us.\n\n  \nWhat baffles me is that in a country with millions of internet users and developers like us, whose lives are directly affected by laws like the Telecom bill, Broadcast bill, Internet shutdowns, Dark patterns, and Data protection laws, from last I got to know, the total number of individuals who do a monthly contribution towards IFF's work is just around 200. Just 200 individual donors in this whole country! This is beyond comprehension. People here boast about earning lakhs and crores through IT jobs, and I don't think it's fair. We all enjoy the internet freedom we currently have, thanks to the work done by organisations like the IFF, who are fighting these battles on the front line.  \n\n\nI was reading their latest email about the winter season in Parliament (https://mailchi.mp/internetfreedom/iff-members-donors-briefing-call-regulating-online-gaming-12671501). Just between January 2023 and November 2023, the IFF had a gap of approximately 23 lakh rupees between what they received in donations (from individuals and organisations) and their total expenses (including operations, salaries, legal expenses, etc.). They will need to organize more fundraisers to cover this gap. While we can all support them in our individual capacity and let them do the work they are meant to do, they are forced to invest time and energy into running these fundraisers.  \nPlease take a look at these links to see their work and social media activities:\n\n  \n[https://twitter.com/internetfreedom](https://twitter.com/internetfreedom)\n\n[https://internetfreedom.in/legal/](https://internetfreedom.in/legal/)\n\n[https://internetfreedom.in/posts/](https://internetfreedom.in/posts/) (You should read and see how well they have documented and posted about various policies and laws in India, and very actively too)\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/internetfreedom.in/](https://www.instagram.com/internetfreedom.in/) (Do watch the videos they post)  \n[https://www.youtube.com/@InternetFreedomFoundation](https://www.youtube.com/@internetfreedomfoundation)\n\n[https://forum.internetfreedom.in/](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/) (Discourse forum)  \n[https://forum.internetfreedom.in/t/financial-disclosure-2023/3368/10](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/t/financial-disclosure-2023/3368/10) (Monthly financial disclosure)\n\n  \nI have personally been donating to them for years, starting with a few hundred rupees when I could, and gradually increasing the amount as my salary increased. My request to everyone here is to start donating to them, however much you can, every month. It will be worth every penny. If you cannot donate, just spread the word about the work they do.",

        "Id": "1ao43zj",
        "Body": "I will keep my profile a bit ambigious to ensure privacy. I will not share my company's name\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My credentials:**\n\nWorking in India throughout. 5 YOE, laid off twice. Once during last year's process from a FAANG, second during this year's process from a fintech which ran into difficulties. 1st one was my fault but caught me unaware, second I expected seeing the company's state.\n\nSalary progression: Started: 13 lpa\n\n1st year 15 lpa\n\n2nd year 32 lpa (Got promoted)\n\n3rd year: 54 lpa (Salary hike all across tech)\n\n4th  year: 36 lpa (Got laid off, joined at lower salary)\n\n5th year: 90 lpa (Got laid off, somehow got a very good salary job)\n\nHave interviewed a ton. Have appeared for all sorts of companies from very huge tech to startups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow are my observations. Fair warning, it might be biased according to my experiences.\n\n**My tips and observations:**\n\n1. General:\n   1. Have general coding and system design practise. But practise for each interview specifically (will explain more below). Initially my practise was generic and so I missed out at places\n   2. Currently most interviews require you to be 95%+ correct or you might not get callback. I have had interviews which I answered and solved all questions well before the hour (40ish min) but because I didn't know say the inner working of transactional dbsI was rejected.\n   3. If asked about salary expectations, never say a flat number. Say \"according to industry standards\", \"more than current\", \"I do not have a number in mind etc\". Try to postpone saying a flat number to a later date to atleast enter into the interview process.\n2. For tech screening round,\n   1. Prepare college fundamentals like transactional dbs, multithreading, oops etc. Some language specific knowledge of java like lambdas is recommended if backend or full stack.\n   2. People tend to ask very obscure questions which only they might know in their niche. Example: If the position you've applied to has products in say network analysis or security, those will be the questions asked. Do prepare for them\n3. For coding rounds:\n   1. These are mostly standard rounds. You code you pass, be vocal and justify each decision\n4. For design rounds:\n   1. The interview question is always 1 of 2 possibilities:\n      1. Either one of the first few questions from Grokking the system design book. (I have been asked the tinyurl question too many times now)\n      2. The team which you are interviewing for will have a product. If you know it, that will be the design asked. Example: If cybersecurity, their tool's design. If big data aggregation, their product etc. Always practise a hypothetical design of the product of the team which you are interviewing for.\n5. Fit rounds:\n   1. Have definite answers to tough questions. Indian interviewers tend to ask the most personal questions and try to undermine you, be prepared.\n   2. I have failed this interview a ton. When I didn't admit I was laid off, I barely passed this. Later on when I admitted the same and prepared I began getting more callbacks\n   3. Do not take this interview for granted. I personally made a list of questions which I have or might be asked and created answers and practised them.\n   4. Since this is mostly the last interview and it's rather subjective you will not always get an honest answer or even sometimes an answer at all.  Be ready to hound HRs for a response.\n\nOne very generic observation is Indian interviewers always tend to ask difficult, obscure, niche, personal questions. Only have met 1 foreigner who has asked such questions. Be prepared and all the best\n\n**Edit:** Regarding how to land interviews. My suggestions are:\n\n1. Contact recruiters in your network from the front. Recruiters generally work for some company, do message them and find people in their network. Generally different recruiters are hiring for different profiles\n2. You will convert  a very low percentage of messages you send out or a very low percentage of jobs you apply for. Do keep it in mind and keep applying\n3. It takes time to start getting interviews. You might start applying today, but will receive callbacks only after 2-3 weeks. Do be patient and keep applying\n4. Do check for referrals from people in your connection. Generally, people do give referrals to others relatively easily\n5. Do make a list of companies you want to join and check their career page. Career page sometimes have openings not present on linkedin\n6. Basics is do apply via websites like linkedin, indeed, naukri etc\n7. Do check out sites like uplers, turing, crossover etc. If you clear their AI screening process you will definitely get a callback. Most people I see give up before that assessment or don't give it seriously\n8. Do check for linkedin jobs you like. They will have tags, do ensure to add them to your profile and CV. Recruiters search with tags. Having them in your profile increases visibility.\n\nPeople with experience do add more suggestions in the comments.",

Plus, you get to learn more about your team members and management, your decisions are influenced.\n\nYes the benefits of having remote location is immense,\nYou get to save a lot of money, you spend time with loved ones but the demerit is that nobody really cares in the online mode.

        "Body": "We're interviewing for a founding engineer (Java backend) position for our startup based in Chandigarh.\n\nWe are looking at devs who have 2+ years of experience in Java. Finding a quality developer is proving to be a task, and I'm about to vent my frustrations \n\n \n\n1. The \"Java Experts\": So many candidates claimed to be Java experts, but they couldn't even explain the basics. It's confusing when someone says they're an expert but can't explain simple OOPS concepts\n2. The Buzzword Overload: Candidates love to throw around tech buzzwords like \"microservices\" and \"scalability,\" but when I asked them to explain these concepts or use them in practical situations, they were lost.\n3. Startup phobia: Some candidates didn't show up or declined because we are a startup, despite us telling them we are profitable and promising a stable job for at least a year. They would rather slog at their jobs than grabbing this opportunity to grow quickly.  \n4. Overconfident and Underprepared: Some candidates came across as overly confident, bragging about their Java projects. However, when I asked for details, they couldn't back it up. Confidence is great, but skills matter more.\n5. Algorithmic Teasers: Solving basic algorithm problems seemed impossible for many candidates. It's like they'd never seen a simple loop before. This made the interviews incredibly frustrating.\n6. The \"Years of Experience\" Trap: Many candidates boasted about years of experience, but  struggle to write basic SQL queries. \n\n In conclusion, the struggle to find a developer who can code, communicate, and genuinely cares about their craft is real. \n\nEdit:\nIt's really amusing to see how quickly people love to jump to conclusions. As they say, if jumping to conclusions was a sport, India would have won Olympic gold medals.\nHere are some more details based on comments:\n\n1. When I mentioned \"stable job for at least a year\" : people didn't understand what 'at least' means here..we are profitable enough to guarantee that there won't be layoffs for a year even if everything goes 0 today.\n2. We are offering up to 12LPA at 2 YOE level, it's above market average salary. \n3. We are a service as well as product based company. We want to remain bootstrapped to launch the product and services is a way to achieve that. There's nothing wrong in doing service business either.",

Our lunch was filled with only a few awkward exchanges. \n\nAdditionally, the director encouraged me to ask questions about the product, but my anxiety held me back, and I simply replied with a vague \"sure.\"\n\nI can't help but dwell on this situation and worry that I've left a terrible first impression. It's causing me to reconsider whether I should go through with joining the company.\n\nNote: This was just a meet and greet, and I will be joining them in 2 months.\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the replies. Yes, my social skills are not good and will surely work on them.",

When I checked git logs, there were bunch of commits from last night of my manager.\n\nNow that manager is a dear friend of the CTO so naturally he didn't say a word to her and instead lashed out at me that why these issues keep coming up and indirectly said I am a poor developer\n\nUsually I don't mind his words but this poor developer thing hurt me.\n\nAnd that manager has the CTC of 50LPA and she writes code like a 11th grader. \nIt always baffles me why is she getting paid that much. She has never worked as a developer before joining us and only \"tech\" experience she has is from a service based company she founded with the help of her friend.\n\nI am not a bad developer at all. I only have 1.6 yrs of experience and whatever I have learnt is on my own. My manager doesn't know nodeJs and she holds the profile of VP of engineering, my CTO has told to my face that he wanna get out of tech. \n\nI have no senior to whom can I ask for doubts or any sort of guidance/help.\n\nFor fucks sake, these guys didn't even know about redis and would directly hit database for all queries and aggregation untill I suggested we should put common APIs behind a cache server.\n\nAnyways, I am looking for a nodeJs job around Delhi NCR area.\n\nI am quick learner but don't judge me on mt DSA skills as I haven't touched them in awhile.\n\nPlease help me find a new job and I would be greatly grateful to you.",

I was a front-end developer and the organization at which I worked hardly received projects and showed less faith in novice developers. Along with resignation came something which I pray nobody should ever suffer. I had a retinal detachment in one eye and had to get a surgery done and the recovery period is too long (still recovering from it). Also, during this period I decided to make a switch in my career from developer to Data Science and Analysis. So I signed up for a course (which is about to end in a few months) and also started looking out for job as a Data Analyst. While I am applying from LinkedIn I am getting rejected either due to poor ATS score (I got a mediocre resume) and even if I do get shortlisted the companies are taking too long to reveal the result.  While I am keeping myself busy with this course I still am suffering mentally with no job in hand. Although my father is bearing the finances even after the surgery, I can't let him bear all the expenses, since he is also getting older. And also getting job referrals is quite a struggle as I have to pay a premium for it in order to contact the recruiters. And even if I do get any referrals the odds of getting selected is also less as there is too much competition for that single position. And because of all these thoughts I am feeling mentally distressed and I don't know what to do ?",

It's a small thing but if more folks did it, it could help feed metrics into recruitment folks that roles are not getting filled because of the inability to offer remote roles.",
